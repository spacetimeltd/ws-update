But shopping for school supplies can be even more difficult if your child has special needs. If your child has a physical or developmental disability that affects their ability to write effectively and comfortably, then this list is for you. We&#8217;ll be looking at five products that can improve your child&#8217;s writing.</p>
<h3>1. The Gripper</h3>
<div id=""attachment_1634"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/gripper.html""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1634"" title=""The Gripper"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/445e707e7b3c6abf6833767130c6c0b6.jpeg"" alt=""The Gripper"" width=""300"" height=""273"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">The Gripper</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a saying that the best solution is often the simplest one. <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/gripper.html"">The Gripper</a> fits squarely into that philosophy. It provides relief from writing cramps and compensates for grasp limitations. The Gripper is cushioned and the regular size fits most pens and pencils. Not only is it comfortable, it also improves your child&#8217;s ability to control the pen or pencil. For even more versatility, The Gripper is also available in assorted sizes to fit other items such as artists&#8217; brushes and eating utensils.</p>
<h3>2. Pediatric Universal Weighted Holder</h3>
<div id=""attachment_1635"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/pediuniholder.html""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-1635"" title=""Pediatric Universal Weighted Holder"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/8994d1a0c5578442f0a0965dc6629605-300x200.jpg"" alt=""Pediatric Universal Weighted Holder"" width=""300"" height=""200"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Pediatric Universal Weighted Holder</p></div>
<p>This <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/pediuniholder.html"">weighted holder</a> sets out to solve several writing problems. For starters, it makes various writing utensils easier to grip. It&#8217;s also weighted. The additional weight is great for stabilizing the hand for kids with hand trembling. The weight also helps kids with weaker hands by reducing the amount of pressure they need to apply when bearing down with the writing utensil.</p>
<h3>3. The Twist-n-Write Pencil</h3>
<div id=""attachment_1636"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 205px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/twistnwrite.html""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1636"" title=""Twist-n-Write Pencil"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/3dc0192faa12f125639bdfb26bdde786.jpeg"" alt=""Twist-n-Write Pencil"" width=""195"" height=""221"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Twist-n-Write Pencil</p></div>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/twistnwrite.html"">Twist-n-Write Pencil</a> was designed especially for children&#8217;s small hands. It offers an ergonomic, wishbone design that promotes an efficient &#8220;tripod&#8221; grasp. The Twist-n-Write Pencil never needs sharpening and comes with a No. 2, 2 mm stick of lead. Simply twisting the cap provides more lead and refills are available (sold separately). In addition it has two erasers and comes in fun assorted colors that your child will love.</p>
<h3>4. Wanchik&#8217;s Pediatric Writer</h3>
<div id=""attachment_1637"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/wanchiksjunior.html""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1637"" title=""Wanchik's Pediatric Writer"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/05c2de1f9107f0d62f7ae91d1760c3af.jpeg"" alt=""Wanchik's Pediatric Writer"" width=""300"" height=""264"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Wanchik&#39;s Pediatric Writer</p></div>
<p><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/wanchiksjunior.html"">Wanchik&#8217;s Pediatric Writer</a> is great for kids with weakened hands or fingers, or lessened finger/wrist dexterity. The device slides on the hand and holds the writing utensil in place. It provides a ring for the writing finger to help keep the finger in the proper position. The device&#8217;s special design allows for a more relaxed hand when writing by holding the utensil and providing hand support.</p>
<h3>5. Squiggle Wiggle Writer</h3>
<div id=""attachment_1638"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/squigglewiggle.html""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1638"" title=""Squiggle Wiggle Writer"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cf1f66ffd1b4b1e16038e9105564f5f9.jpeg"" alt=""Squiggle Wiggle Writer"" width=""300"" height=""241"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Squiggle Wiggle Writer</p></div>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/squigglewiggle.html"">Squiggle Wiggle Writer</a> is a battery operated vibrating pen that turns straight lines into a series of loops, circles, or curves, depending on how close it is held to the writing surface. Not only is it outrageously fun, it gives tactile stimulation and encourages appropriate grasp. Occupational and developmental therapists love the Squiggle Wiggle Writer for young writers as it helps them develop better coordination.</p>
<h3>Make writing easy and fun for your child</h3>
<p>Taking on the new school year is hard enough for you and your child. But writing shouldn&#8217;t be. These <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/writingaids.html"">adapted writing utensils</a> can help kids with a variety of special needs and make writing easy and fun.</p>

Composed of a durable, specially weighted rubber compound, great care was taken to control the right amount of flexibility, giving the base its remarkable performance. 

Stairs are now easily managed. Quad canes need to be turned sideways on stairs, making the user uncomfortable and in some cases fearful. The <b>AbleTripod®</b> gives the user confidence to negotiate even the narrowest steps. 

The stress of impact on the user's hand is greatly reduced by the <b>AbleTripod® Base</b>, which flexes as you walk. The tips of the pods flex, grabbing while permitting the AbleTripod® to roll through, maintaining contact with the ground. The stability of the AbleTripod® base is not compromised whether on grass, gravel or sand , whereas typical canes may sink into the ground. 

The <b>AbleTripod® Walking Cane Tip</b> can be used in ways that no other cane can: its unique design enables the user to lean into the cane, experiencing both support and balance. The ability to lateralize gives the user a unique feeling of confidence, knowing that the AbleTripod® is less likely to slip out than quad canes. 

The patented <b>AbleTripod® Base</b> easily replaces your walking cane tip, addressing all of these issues and more. 

The base comes in 4 standard-size openings: 5/8"", 3/4"", 7/8"", 1"" and 11/16""

We search for and deliver useful tools, appliances, equipment, and rehabilitation products that help make accomplishing daily tasks less difficult.",,No,,,"<b>Thank you for shopping online with The Wright Stuff, Inc.</b><br><br>We get allot of calls and one of the most asked questions is ""Are you a real Company"". The answer is - yes. We started our business in 1999, just outside of Nashville, in Smyrna, TN. We have relocated twice. Once to Grenada, MS, then to our current location, Crystal Springs, MS. Crystal Springs is our home town, so, hopefully, we will be here awhile.<br><br>We are located in a 27,000 square foot facility that we purchased in 2010. We warehouse over 90% of what we sell, so we sometimes say, hold on, let me go get one so we can better describe the item. Some of the heavier items, we do drop ship from the manufacturer to the customer. This helps to reduce the cost of shipping heavier items from the manufacturer to us, then to the customer.<br><br>We also have staff that has actually worked in the health-care setting with patients. We are not a bunch of computer people selling health-care products on the Internet.<br><br>So, yes, we are a real company. We rely on this business to pay our bills and put our children through school. And, maybe most importantly, we actually started this business with the goal of helping people find products that make life a little easier.<br><br><h4>Our Mission </h4><br>Our goal is to be the leading provider of unique home medical supplies for people with varying physical needs. We search for and deliver useful tools, appliances, equipment, and rehabilitation products that help make accomplishing daily tasks less difficult.<br><br><h4>Our Background </h4><br>As a licensed physical therapist working with geriatrics, I have found that people often are frustrated with simple tasks that are becoming increasingly more difficult. In many situations, the right product will lessen the difficultly of such a challenge. Most everyone I have treated has been a candidate for some type of home health aid, adapted device, joint support, or therapeutic product. My husband and I realized that although home medical equipment is readily available, unique therapeutic products which therapists recommend are more difficult to locate. <br><br>Thus, we developed this idea: that we could bring these products to the people that need them. With my skills as a therapist to identify products that are practical and useful, combined with my husband's business background, our company was established in 1999. Chris has been a healthcare administrator and consultant for over 10 years, has a degree in marketing and a master's degree in business administration. <br><br><h4>Our Promise to You </h4><br>We welcome any comments, suggestions, or questions about these products. We have chosen products that are well made from dependable suppliers and manufacturers. We hope you will enjoy browsing the WrightStuff.biz website, and feel confident that any product you choose will make your life a little easier! <br><br>Thanks for shopping with us, <br><br>Chris and Amy Wright

In the fall of 2007, my mom asked if I would help keep track of her checking account. She expressed a fear of making a serious financial mistake because she had been forgetting to write entries in her ledger. My mother had never missed a payment, successfully balancing her checkbook to her 80th year. But there she was, asking me for help. This thoroughly independent lady painfully relinquished control of her finances. 

As time went on, she had to give up more and more control as she experienced a number of strokes and the onslaught of Alzheimer's. By the end of 2008, she could no longer live independently and moved into an assisted living facility. The doctors told her she had Alzheimer's/Dementia for a number of years, which was taking a toll on her health. She was in and out of hospitals five times in her last year. One of the hospitals provided a television channel with 24/7 videos and music. We watched for hours, and I quizzed her on the flowers and trees on the television. You see, I am a landscape designer with a background in horticulture. My mom got me interested in plants at a young age. She helped me get a job at a local nursery when I was 13 years old. 

One day in the hospital, I thought about using the thousands of flower photographs I have taken over the years to make a DVD video for persons with Alzheimer's and other dementia. The pictures of flowers along with music from the early 20th Century bring back warm memories in a beautiful, relaxing format. The video is 60 minutes long and has over 400 high-quality images of flowers. Some pictures include birds, bees or butterflies. The music consists of classics such as America The Beautiful, Shine On Harvest Moon, Just A Closer Walk, A Bicycle Built For Two, Amazing Grace, and God Be With You Till We Meet Again. 

My mother lost her battle with Alzheimer's in June of 2009, but her legacy lives on through the video by helping others appreciate the beauty of God's creation.

It was invented in 1970 by W. R. McElroy, Ph. D. AKTON polymer is the primary material in all of these products. It is what separates us from the competition.
<br><br>
No one has AKTON polymer but Action Products, and it is a wondrous material. It looks and feels like a gel, but is more body friendly. It also carries a longer warranty. We once parked a full-sized car on it and moved the wheels. It didn't bottom out or tear, it has memory!
<br><br>
AKTON polymer won't leak, flow, or bottom out, and it is tissue equivalent. It contains no latex, plasticizers, or silicones, which are often the cause of allergic reactions. It moves with wheelchair users, not against them, to reduce pressure and shear, the two leading causes of pressure sores.
<br><br>
AKTON polymer is also radiolucent and easy to clean with standard disinfectant. It will not support microbiological growth, and it won't absorb body fluids or odors.
<br><br>
In addition, AKTON polymer is fire-rated as self-extinguishing. Should it be accidentally damaged, you can easily repair it on site.
<br><br>
Action Products, Inc. makes wheelchair cushions and seating systems; heel and elbow protectors, and full mattress overlays for Rehab/DME markets. These products are used in hospitals, long-term care facilities, in home care, and wheelchairs. 
<br><br>
These products are unrivaled in reducing the development of decubitus ulcers, or pressure sores. They form when people lie or sit for extended periods on operating tables, beds, or wheelchairs. Decubitus ulcers are serious tissue traumas that can penetrate through skin and muscle to the bone. Prevention of pressure ulcers will help patients avoid needless pain, suffering and, in the worst cases, death.

But don't take our word for it. Read what the medical community has to say about our products. You can do so on our Clinical Studies white papers pages.

Akton Mattress Overlays are made of 100% Akton Polymer. These mattress overlays are used to cover the entire surface or isolated areas of an existing standard mattress. Used by hospitals and long term care facilities as a significant component in prevention and treatment of decubitus ulcers. Akton Polymer will not migrate like gels, does not promote bacterial growth, and is ideal for multiple client use. 

Akton 5/8 inch Full Mattress Overlays provide high pressure and shear reduction that requires no pumps, electricity or special training to use. The 5/8 inch layer of AKTON polymer can be used under clients with existing decubitus ulcers and increases bed surface height only 5/8 inch, providing for independent stable transfers.

Some models are available with a hook and loop hitch used to secure one end of the overlay to the head of the bed. The hitch will reduce slippage when the bed is raised.

<p>Caring for a patient, spouse, or parent who has needs can be stressful. 
As a caregiver, you are well aware of this. The patient-caregiver 
relationship is a symbiotic one: when they are feeling pain and 
discomfort, that mood spills over and affects everyone. When they are 
comfortable and relatively pain-free, that mood can recharge and enliven people 
around them.</p>
<p>The best way to find out ""where it hurts"" is simply to come out and ask that 
blunt question. And keep in mind that ""where it hurts"" is not always targeted specifically to their ailment. For example, an epileptic 
may not appear to have anything visibly wrong after a seizure. After all, 
don't seizures happen in the brain? Yet epileptics knows very well the 
intense pain in their legs, arms, and neck from the physical strain associated with grand 
mal seizures. </p>
<p>""Where does it hurt? How can I help?"" you ask. Don't be surprised 
if you don't receive a clear, concise answer. Folks who are experiencing 
pain and discomfort often cannot verbalize how they really feel. But the 
more important issue is that they usually<i> do not know </i>how to alleviate the pain.</p>
<p>Caregiver, you can help by researching the answers and then presenting these 
to your spouse or patient.</p>
<p>For instance, how could 
they know about a wonderful source of comfort called
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/912440"" target=""_blank"">Medibeads</a>? 
It is understandable that they may never have heard of these
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/912440"" target=""_blank"">moist heat 
wraps</a> that warm gently in the microwave; are 100% hygienic; can never get 
too hot; are simple to use; and are environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>If you know some features of this product--which is the next generation 
beyond electric heating pads--you can describe them to your spouse, parent, or 
patient, and ask if they would be willing to try it.</p>
<p>Bedding aids are another area where most people will be surprised to hear of 
the many different products now available. Are they aware of
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911693"" target=""_blank"">triangular 
knee rest pillows</a> which allow them to elevate their legs ""just so""? 
How about <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911693"" target=""_blank"">
crescent-shaped pillows</a> that gently cradle the neck or
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911693"" target=""_blank"">knee pillows</a> 
designed specifically to separate uncomfortable knees?</p>
<p>Many folks with pain or discomfort simply feel that they are being too much 
of a burden to ask for special assistive products. Assuring them that most 
of these products are reasonably priced often isn't enough to do the trick. 
But if you convince them that assistive devices make <i>your job </i>easier, 
they may be agreeable to trying them out. Patients and spouses 
who experience pain are typically sensitive to the jobs that their caregivers 
must perform.</p>
<p>Communication and listening with an open heart as well as open ears is the 
best way to assure that comfort needs can be adequately met.</p>

<p>Everyone needs their personal space.  While most people have a social side, there is a time and a place for strictly personal functions.  A warm bath or shower.  Or dressing in the morning.  Or <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461273"" target=""_blank"">drying one’s hair or clipping nails</a>.</p>
<p>Arthritis persons often rely on caregivers to provide these personal services.  But there are several problems with this.  First is the issue of reliance.  While it is all well and good to rely on a spouse, this care may not always be consistent if the spouse begins to experience medical problems.</p>
<p>Most important is the basic human need to take care of personal functions by one’s self.  Self-esteem is rooted in self-reliance.  For example, the ability to <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/getting-ready.html"" target=""_blank"">bathe on one’s own with the help of arthritic aids</a> may encourage the development of other healthy patterns.</p>
<p>In fact, in 1995 researchers at Arizona State University studied situations in which a spouse had rheumatoid arthritis while the other spouse did not have this disorder.  Results of the research strongly show that the behavior of one spouse to the other affects the health and well-being of the spouse experiencing arthritis.</p>
<h3>Toiletry Assistance with Specially Adapted Aids for Arthritics</h3>
<p>Few personal functions are quite so personal as those that happen on the toilet.  Soon after we are born, our urinary patterns and bowel movements become almost a public spectacle.  It is discussed at length by our parents.  It is sometimes on display in public places when diapers are changed.</p>
<p>But by the time we are older, we have reclaimed our personal toilet space.  It is ours and it is forever private.  Or so we think.  For arthritic persons, personal toilet habits often become semi-private, shared with spouses or caregivers.</p>
<p>Arthritic persons can <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/913209"" target=""_blank"">reclaim their personal bathroom space with special toileting aids</a>.  These range from elevated toilet seats or seats with support bars to more intimate items such as toilet tissue tongs and extended toilet wipers.  With this wide variety of tested, hygienic aids, arthritic persons should feel no need to sacrifice self-reliance while performing toiletry functions. </p>  
<h3>Buttoning and Zipping Assistance for Arthritic Persons</h3>
<p>“Rings and things and buttons and bows,” goes the cheerful, popular song from the 1940s.  But ask any arthritic person who is trying to close up her blouse, and she’ll tell you that buttons do not make for a happy song.</p>
<p>Buttons and zippers.  Do you remember the day when zipper tabs were large enough to actually grasp?  How much smaller and more difficult can they make them?  The fact is, buttons and zippers have never been easy.</p>
<p>Neat little <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/911568"" target=""_blank"">zipping and buttoning gadgets</a> for arthritic persons help make this process easy and comfortable.  How about rubber-gripped zipper pulls?  Or button threading aids?  Or nice T-handled zipper pulls?</p>   
<p>Velcro buttons eliminate the need for buttons altogether.  And what about those frustrating zippers on the backs of dresses or blouses?  An eighteen-inch corded zipper pull lets any lady close it up herself—all without asking, “Honey, would you come here for a moment…?”</p>

<h3>Question:</h3>
<p>&quot;My husband suffers from arthritis so badly that almost everything he 
does causes him pain and discomfort. You can imagine what this has done to 
our social life! We hardly go out anymore. The thing of it is, I 
think he really does want to go out. It's just the arthritis that's 
holding him back.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Expert Says:</h3>
<p>This is perfectly normal. When a person's arthritis is getting him or 
her down, typically that person can't think past the front door. Or in 
many cases, even past the bed! The first thing a non-arthritic person should do is to 
avoid blaming the spouse. Arthritis can be very debilitating, and people 
suffer with it in varying degrees of pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>But you are half of this marriage, and unfortunately this marriage does happen to 
include arthritis. Why should you be affected, too?</p>
<p>Take the initiative and introduce your husband to the wide variety of 
supplies available to help arthritics get out and about.</p>
<p>First order of business is to get him out of the bed. Over the years, 
manufacturers have come up with a
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461326"" target=""_blank"">remarkable 
set of devices called standing aids</a>. Let's look at the various types 
of standing aids:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Does he have difficulty getting up from his chair or sofa? There 
	are neat risers to help him from his chair or grips and canes to get up from 
	the sofa.</li>
	<li>Once he's up, can he pivot in place while you assist him with dressing? 
	Pivot discs, like lazy susans for people, help arthritic persons accomplish 
	tight maneuvers.</li>
	<li>In the car, can he get out by himself? Remember--once in public, 
	most men would rather walk through broken glass than have their wife help 
	them out of cars. Strong nylon loops called Car 
	Caddies--strength-rated well past his weight--help him <i>help himself </i>
	out of the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that your husband is standing, you've only won half the battle. Now 
you've got to get him to the mall, store, party, or over to the grandchildren. 
If his doctor has given him the nod,
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">walkers and 
canes</a> are perhaps the easiest way to him to move around. On top of 
that, he'll feel more independent. As for you, walkers and canes are 
lighter and more portable, because you'll be the one storing them in the car 
trunk.</p>
<p>But he may need more stability and support. If he's got a wheelchair, 
he'll probably want some
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">wheelchair 
add-ons</a> that make going out much more fun. How about a wheelchair 
backpack to store those library books you'll be picking up? Or a brake 
lever extension to make him feel safer and more stable? Or if you're going out 
for coffee, how about a cupholder for that large cup of French Roast?</p>
<p>So, there's no need for arthritis to keep you or your husband homebound--not 
with all the wonderful arthritic supplies available to keep you on the move!</p>

The material is forged steel with corrosion resistant plating.

The precisely shaped nose locks the <b>Handybar</b> securely into position with little effort and enables it to be removed just as easily. It is also cranked, or bent, over its length to enable it to be reversed to give just the right height and angle of grip for getting in and out of a vehicle. 

Smaller, more compact cars tend to be lower down, closer to the ground making it even more difficult to get in and out of them. Fortunately, the U-type striker plate is one of the most rugged components in a vehicle being designed to keep the door closed in the event of a side-impact crash. There is a striker on each of the door pillars enabling the <b>Handybar</b> to be used by both the driver and passengers.

baofhoaspr,"baofhoaspr",,,No,,,No,"articles","Usually ships the next business day",,"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/makinglifeeasier/",,,,"articles",,"Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Caregiver Articles and Information:Around the House",No,,,"<p>Are you new to caregiving? Do you have a new patient, or a spouse or 
parent, who recently has become unable to tend to him or herself? If so, 
then this is as new to you as it is to them.</p>
<p>So, it's time to educate yourself on what's out there. By this time, 
you probably realize that you need assistance <i>in assisting them</i>. We call 
these adaptive or assistive products. </p>
<h3>Adaptive/Assistive Products: A Definition</h3>
<p>The main idea behind adaptive or assistive products is that they help close 
the gap between what a person <i>wants</i> to do and what a person is currently 
<i>capable</i> 
of doing. For example, your husband may truly wish to rise from bed by 
himself, but because of injury, illness, or age, he is unable to do so. 
Thus, you must assist him. An assistive device, such as a
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45018"" target=""_blank"">bed caddy</a>, 
helps him raise himself up in bed by himself. The bed caddy closes the gap 
between his want (sit up by himself) and his current ability (he cannot do so).</p>
<h3>Products that Fit in With Everyday Life</h3>
<p>The second idea behind assistive devices is that, for the most part, they aid the person with tasks that he or she already does. In other words: everyday tasks. Assistive devices rarely impose new activities upon the 
person. For instance,
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45018"" target=""_blank"">wall switch 
extensions</a> are available which give wheelchair users and others the ability to turn 
light switches on and off more easily and comfortably. Flipping switches 
is an ordinary, everyday task, and the assistive device merely...assists. 
But it does not replace the task with an unfamiliar task.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45018"" target=""_blank"">Weighted 
toothbrush and razor holders</a> provide weight to keep hand tremors at bay. 
But they do not usurp the job of brushing teeth or shaving.</p>
<h3>Less Familiar Assistive Products Adopted Quickly</h3>
<p>In a few cases, the assistive products bear little resemblance to the 
products they are replacing.
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45018"" target=""_blank"">Table-mounted 
scissors</a> at first glance may resemble a paper-cutter more than conventional 
scissors. Or what about pen holders with a ""yoke"" to allow the index 
finger to steady the pen--these may warrant a raised eyebrow. Yet typically 
these assistive products are so easy to ""catch onto"" and have such a high degree 
of functionality that users quickly adapt to them, and then later swear that 
they couldn't imagine living without them.</p>
<h3>Assistive Products: Designed to Help</h3>
<p>Finally, all assistive products are very well-designed and are made for the 
specific purpose of helping people with everyday tasks. Also, these 
products often result from extensive testing or from real-life needs. For 
instance, a
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/product/AST420"" target=""_blank"">lever 
extender for reclining chairs</a> has one and only one purpose: to assist 
folks who have trouble pulling back the recliner lever.
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/product/CPO643"" target=""_blank"">Bed 
cradles</a>, which hold bed covers comfortably above feet, were designed and 
created just for that sole purpose.</p>
<p>Investigate the wide variety of assistive devices out there <i>to help you</i> 
help your spouse, patient, or parent become more independent in everyday life.</p>

Healthcare professionals are increasingly recognizing obesity as a risk factor for diabetes and associated complications, including heel pressure ulcers.
<br><br>
Heelift® Bariatric Suspension Boot helps prevent heel pressure ulcers in patients who are particularly prone to suffer from the condition. Specifically, Heelift Bariatric was developed for patients weighing up to 600 pounds who have a calf circumference of between 
12 to 23 inches.
<br><br>
Like Heelift Standard, Heelift Bariatric offloads the heel by redistributing pressure from the heel to the patient's calf. The design of Heelift Bariatric minimizes contact 
between the patient's leg and objects that can cause pressure at the heel or at folds in the skin. Rounded, adjustable straps and a smooth, friction-free tricot backing also ensure that the Heelift will not rub against or cause impressions on the patient's other leg. 
<br><br>
Together with diligent care and monitoring, Heelift Bariatric can help even the most at-risk patients prevent heel pressure ulcers.
<br><br>

<h4>Heelift Bariatric Suspension Boot Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extended Stitching: Located along the top rim, the added stitching narrows the forefoot and increases support to provide improved protection against foot drop, equines deformity, or heel cord contracture.</li>
<li>""Easy-on, easy-off"" rounded straps and D-ring closures: Padded Velcro® straps are easy for the patient and/or healthcare professional to use and can easily be adjusted to accommodate specific patient needs.</li>
<li>Friction-free tricot backing: Unlike other suspension products, which can have sharp edges on the back that can rub against the patient's other leg, Heelift is manufactured with a smooth tricot backing that aids in patient mobility and helps ensure patient safety.</li>
<li>Smooth foam: Heelift Bariatric is available in Smooth foam only. Smooth foam is ideal for patients with edematous legs as it will not create ""impressions"" on the leg.</li>
<li>Ventilation holes: Ventilation holes provide additional air circulation to promote increased patient comfort.</li>
<li>Tricot covered stiffener: This feature prevents Heelift from buckling for added patient comfort and safety.</li>
<li>The Heelift features forefoot support using a spring back technology to keep the foot upright.</li>
<li>The Heelift can be autoclaved for sterilization. Close the straps and place in a normal autoclave wrapper.</li>

Salts from the Dead Sea have been legendary for centuries for their therapeutic and beatifying properties to the skin. Nothing like regular sea salt, Dead Sea salts are comprised of a wide variety of minerals which are present in a high concentration. Whereas regular sea salt is made up of over 90% sodium, salt from the Dead Sea is only about 10% sodium and the rest is made of minerals which are essential for the proper function and health of skin. Such minerals include Magnesium, Potassium, Bromine and Calcium to name a few. 

Unlike regular salt, Dead Sea salt is not edible and tastes bitter primarily because of the low sodium content and the high presence of other minerals. This fact however gives it the therapeutic properties that have been raved about for centuries. The minerals present in the salt are also naturally present within skin cells but commonly get depleted which can cause severe dryness, wrinkle development and dull looking skin. When Dead Sea bath salts are used for bathing, essential minerals are feed back into the skin cells improving the overall health and vitality of the skin. 

Therapeutic for Arthritis, Muscular Pain, Skin Conditions and Silky Smooth Skin are some of the wonderful benefits you receive from the use of Masada products. For thousands of years, the Dead Sea has been the destination for millions seeking its therapeutic blend of mineral salts for temporary relief from psoriasis, arthritis, muscular pain and for the utmost in tension relaxation. 

Exclusive Masada Dead Sea Mineral Salts are 100% natural, imported in unprocessed form from the southernmost part of the Dead Sea, where mineral concentration is richest. Dead Sea Mineral Salts are unchallenged as the optimal therapeutic bath salts.",,"Masada Dead Sea Mineral Bathing Salts ","Helps replace essential minerals back into the skin cells improving the overall health and vitality of the skin.","New",,"The Wright Stuff, Inc."

<h4>The ""No-Lift"" Frictionless BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer System</h4>
BeasyTrans™ Systems are totally portable. With the BeasyTrans™ Systems, most users can achieve regular access to an automobile. For some, this may mean a greater quality of life. The visiting of friends and relatives may be resumed. Educational and cultural undertakings can be attended. The systems may even allow the user to live at home while receiving outpatient care, rather than living in a long term facility and even for travelling!
<h4>Tissue Friendly - Elimination of Skin Friction</h4>
It's a well documented fact: lifting leads to injury. For example, patient movement tasks statistically place nursing personnel in the top percentile of the U.S. labor force for back injuries. At the same time, the person being lifted is at risk for arm and brachial plexus type injuries as well as back injuries from being torqued or twisted. The risk of such injuries is tremendously reduced when lifting is eliminated. The frictionless, lateral slide is clearly the state of the art in patient transfer. 
<h4>Versatility</h4>
The design of the BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer Systems make it possible to apply sliding technology to a wide range of transfer and therapeutic functions in both the clinical and homecare environment. 

For example, strategic placement of the Beasy seat under a draw sheet allows a minimum number of caregivers to easily perform such difficult transfers as bed to gurney, supine, or boosting of patients.

<P>Everybody is looking for more carrying room. Have you noticed the trends with 
cars lately? Big SUVs and trucks have been getting even bigger, allowing drivers 
to carry more passengers, dogs, groceries, and shopping items. Scooters are no 
exception.</P>
<P>While you probably won't be carrying passengers or dogs in your scooter 
anytime soon, you will be amazed at the ever-expanding (no pun intended!) line 
of bags, baskets, and totes that let you carry even more of your essential 
items. If size isn't your thing, you'll be happy to see that scooter carrying 
accessories have gotten smarter and more organized. After all, no one likes 
pawing through twenty items just to find one item. </P>
<H3><A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344391"" target=_""blank"">Seatback 
Bags for Scooters</A></H3>
<P>Typically constructed of sturdy, easily cleanable fabric, the main advantage 
of seatback bags is that they maximize your carrying room. After all, the 
scooter back is the best area of carrying large items. Seatback bags attach and 
detach quickly by means of nylon straps, so you can take them with you when you 
go indoors. </P>
<P>Seatback bags range from mega-sized bags that are essentially one big space 
for your books, groceries, and shopping mall trove (think: a car trunk for your 
scooter) to smaller, more segmented bags that allow you to better organize your 
necessities. One thing you should be aware of with seatback bags is that they 
are not easily accessible while you are riding the scooter. While you do get the 
big carrying room, you pay the price with accessibility. One notable exception: 
it is possible to find seatback bags with side access. You still have to reach 
around the back--difficult if you have impaired hand or arm strength--but it's 
not necessary to get off of the scooter.</P>
<H3><A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344391"" target=_""blank"">Side 
or Saddle Bags for Scooters</A></H3>
<P>You'll gain better accessibility with side or saddle bags that attach to the 
arms of your scooter. Saddle bags have less carrying capacity than seatback 
bags, but you may find that's not an issue with most of your daily tasks. The 
saddle bag straps are soft to the touch--no rough nylon straps to chafe the 
skin. Saddle bags range from small bags appropriate for phones, glasses, and 
paperbacks, all the way up to extra-big saddle bags that can carry a Sunday 
newspaper or even a few canned goods or frozen dinners. Though the big bags hang 
low, not to worry: they always ride high enough to maintain plenty of clearance

Bags for Scooters</A></H3>
<P>""Tiller bags? I don't plan on doing any gardening,"" you might say. Even 
scooter veterans may not know this, but the central console with the ""steering 
wheel"" and drive controls is called a tiller. So there. Now you know.</P>
<P>Tiller bags attach to the tiller, and start small and range up to large 
sizes. Giant-sized tiller bags are not generally available because they impair 
your steering ability. Tiller bags provide accessible storage room for those 
items you use frequently, like glasses and keys. One aspect about tiller bags to 
note: they are not as easy to access as are saddle bags. You may need to leave 
the scooter or lean very far forward to open tiller bags. </P>
<P>Easy cleanable and simple to attach and detach, tiller bags are a popular 
choice among scooter users.</P>

Metal splint positioned at 25 degrees helps prevent wrist movements that can cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Fully adjustable velcro locking straps adjusts for a better fit. 

Thermoskin Thermal Supports contain the exclusive patented Trioxon lining that has been clinically proven to increase your surface and subcutaneous skin temperature 2 to 3° F. 
This helps increase the elasticity of muscles, tendons, and ligaments to reduce the risk of injury when under stress. Thermoskin Thermal Supports also increase the blood flow to damaged tissue to help speed up the healing process, while providing light compression to counteract tissue swelling. The spiral structure of the Trioxon lining creates a micro-climate which allows the skin to ventilate by wicking away moisture and does not close the pores of the skin. You can wear Thermoskin for extended periods of time without the discomfort you would have with other products. Competitive products trap the perspiration resulting in discomfort, risk of infection and unpleasant odor. 

In a recent study Thermoskin Thermal Supports provided “Considerable Relief” or “Total Relief” of pain in 83% of patients.

We come together with friends, family, and (often times) complete strangers to celebrate our freedom and our nation&#8217;s birthday. Fireworks sparkle and faces light up. And in true American style, we throw the burgers on the grill and prepare the quintessential summer delight&#8211;ice cream. In fact, partaking of ice cream is such an important summer tradition that President Ronald Reagan officially declared the month of July to be National Ice Cream Month. And we at The Wright Stuff wholeheartedly agree. That&#8217;s why we put together this collection of adapted dishes and utensils that will help you enjoy this delectable treat.</p>
<h3>Declare your independence with the Freedom Dessert Bowl</h3>
<div id=""attachment_1472"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 234px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/frdebo.html""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1472"" title=""Freedom Dessert Bowl"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/f19937d0ecb34b6766edfbcc21ea3e39.jpeg"" alt=""Freedom Dessert Bowl"" width=""224"" height=""128"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Freedom Dessert Bowl</p></div>
<p>Seniors and people with disabilities often have a difficult time at mealtime. Containers tend to slip and spill and food seems to jump off utensils. And ice cream is one of the worst offenders. All the things that make it so good&#8211;it&#8217;s creamy, smooth, and often covered in chocolate and other toppings&#8211;also make it slip and slide its way off your spoon. That is, if you can get it on the spoon without it splashing out of the bowl.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/frdebo.html"">Freedom Dessert Bowl</a>. It has high sides that not only keep food from spilling out, but serves to help you get the food onto your utensil. You don&#8217;t have to worry about it sliding around on the table because the bowl screws down to the included Freedom Non Skid, No Spill Vacuum Pad. This secures the bowl to the table so that you don&#8217;t have to worry about it moving or tipping over.</p>
<h3>Go for the perfect scoop</h3>
<div id=""attachment_1474"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 125px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/rianscsp.html""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-1474"" title=""Right Angled Scoop Spoon"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/73d885c869724042d253b5056e9c9ad9-115x300.jpg"" alt=""Right Angled Scoop Spoon"" width=""115"" height=""300"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Right Angled Scoop Spoon</p></div>
<p>So you&#8217;ve got your bowl secured and filled with a generous portion of your favorite flavor of ice cream. If it&#8217;s difficult or painful for you to move your upper extremities due to a physical impairment, getting a bite of ice cream down the hatch is not so easy. Ice cream doesn&#8217;t exactly sit nicely on the spoon. More than likely, it will wait until it&#8217;s just about to hit your lips and then force you to watch as it slips off the back of the spoon. That&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re talking the one that got away.</p>
<p>If only there was a spoon with a raised back to keep food from slipping off. I think you know where I&#8217;m going with this. Yes, there is! The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/rianscsp.html"">Right Angled Scoop Spoon</a> allows you to scoop food onto the spoon with just a simple motion of the elbow and the raised back ensures that it stays there.</p>
<h3>Even more Freedom</h3>
<div id=""attachment_1476"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/frdi.html""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-1476"" title=""Freedom Dinnerware"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/5fc55d13759542b946142ea28a91d461-300x168.jpg"" alt=""Freedom Dinnerware"" width=""300"" height=""168"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Freedom Dinnerware</p></div>
<p>From extended rims and built-in dividers to special scoop angles and the patented no slip suction base pad, the entire line of <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/frdi.html"">Freedom Dinnerware</a> dishes are designed to give you back your independence at mealtime. Once you attach the dishes to the Freedom Pad, simply place it on a flat surface and press down slightly. Your dish is now secured and you don&#8217;t have to worry about it sliding around or tipping over. This makes it great not only for people with disabilities and seniors, but for young children as well. Prevent the mess and the hassle of spilled food.</p>
<h3>And a cherry on top</h3>
<p>With the right <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adplplguandb.html"">adaptive dishes</a> and <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adeaut.html"">utensils</a>, disability and other mobility impairments need not keep you from having your cake and eating it too. So get the grill fired up, the fireworks handy, and scoop yourself a big bowl of ice cream. After all, it&#8217;s a free country, and you&#8217;ve earned it!</p>

coasdeba,"coasdeba",,,No,,,No,"articles","Usually ships the next business day",,"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/makinglifeeasier/",,,,"articles",,"Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Caregiver Articles and Information:For Your Comfort",No,,,"<p>As a caregiver, not only are you expected to take care of your patient, 
parent, or husband or wife, but you also must keep on top of trends in assistive 
devices. This can be bewildering, because there are so many different 
types of assistive products on the market designed to provide comfort. Let 
us break it down for you and make the topic easier to understand.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911819"" target=""_blank"">Caring 
for Sensitive Skin</a></h3>
<p>Caregivers often don't know about skin issues until these issues have gotten out of 
control. Skin irritation and dryness is not immediately obvious, 
especially in areas that are not so visible. Caregivers can help their 
patients 
avoid skin irritation and inflammation in the first place by introducing
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911819"" target=""_blank"">comfortable 
skinsleeves</a> that hug the forearms and protect fragile skin. For skin 
that is already damaged,
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911819"" target=""_blank"">specially 
formulated healing creams and moisturizers</a> are available which act as a 
soothing balm for reddened, abraded, and otherwise painful skin.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/912440"" target=""_blank"">Heat 
Wraps for Aching Joints</a></h3>
<p>Another area of concern: achy, painful joints. Traditionally, 
electric heating pads or hot water bottles have been used, but these are messy 
and unhygienic. A better, cleaner and more effective solution are
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/912440"" target=""_blank"">MediBeads 
heat wraps</a>, which are microwavable and do not require water. MediBeads draw ambient water from the atmosphere. They are easily 
cleanable, and they are impossible to ""overcook"" in the microwave.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911693"" target=""_blank"">Bedding 
Aids</a></h3>
<p>If they don't sleep well, their level of comfort for the rest of the day is 
greatly diminished. That's why bedding assistive devices are so important. 
One perennial favorite is the
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911693"" target=""_blank"">knee rest 
pillow</a>, which elevates knees to a comfortable position.
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911693"" target=""_blank"">Crescent 
pillows</a> cradle the head;
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911693"" target=""_blank"">heel pillows</a> 
protect and soothe injured or painful feet; and a wide variety of other
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911693"" target=""_blank"">wedges and 
specialty pillows</a> help them sleep comfortably and soundly.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911791"" target=""_blank"">Cushions 
for Maximum Comfort</a></h3>
<p>When the chair, bed, wheelchair, or toilet are not comfortable enough, 
specialty cushions save the day. For almost any need, there is a
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911791"" target=""_blank"">polymer 
cushion</a> to meet that need. These non-allergenic cushions move with 
your patient or spouse, reducing pressure sores. </p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911818"" target=""_blank"">
Wheelchair Comfort Aids</a></h3>
<p>Wheelchairs are designed for generic users, not for specific patients. 
So, if your patient or parent has a special need, you need to accessorize the 
chair to take care of that need. Patients often feel unsteady in the 
chairs, so <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911818"" target=""_blank"">
side supports and wing backs</a> can help by gently ""hugging"" them and 
positioning them upright. Arms rest more comfortably on
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911818"" target=""_blank"">soft lateral 
arm supports</a> than on those spindly, cold wheelchair arms.</p>

The people at Contour Living have developed a solution. It’s the <b>CPAP Multi-Mask Sleep Aid</b>.

The American Sleep Apnea Association identifies CPAP therapy as the most common treatment for sleep apnea. CPAP therapy works by preventing the airway from closing during sleep. It is administered at bedtime through a nasal or facial mask held in place by velcro straps around the patient’s head. The mask is connected by a tube to a small air compressor. The CPAP machine sends air under pressure through the tube and into the mask, where it imparts positive pressure to the upper airways, preventing the tissues in the back of the throat from collapsing during sleep.

This is an extremely effective form of treatment when used in compliance with doctors orders. However, non-compliance is a big issue. It has been estimated that over 65% of patients use the machine for a maximum of just 4 hours per night when it should be used for the duration of the patient’s sleep. Additionally, many patients report using the CPAP for just a few nights out of the week. 

Discomfort is a major factor contributing to non-compliance. During side sleeping or stomach sleeping, the mask presses and rubs against the patient’s face, which leads to discomfort and can also distort the mask, causing leaks and exacerbating the problem of non-compliance.

<P>Most people immobilized by injury or disorder would choose almost any other 
mobility aid than a crutch. Hospitals dispensing crutches find that while 
patients take to wheelchairs, canes, and walkers fairly quickly, it's the 
crutches that pose a problem. Considering that there are many methods of using 
crutches, it's no wonder that health care facilities must first fit the patient 
with crutches and then provide lessons on how to walk with them. Not only that, 
crutches chafe the skin on hands, underarms, and elsewhere, producing painful 
welts and abrasions.</P>
<P>Simply put, crutches are uncomfortable--at least in their just-dispensed 
form. That's why a person would be crazy not to take advantage of reasonably 
priced <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344389"" target=""_blank"">crutch 
accessories</A> to ease the way.</P>
<H3>Underarm Pain Relieved</H3>
<P>What is the number one body area that gets the most pressure, friction, and 
shock when using crutches? You guessed it: the underarms. Most of the carrying 
weight is concentrated on the underarms, producing inflammation and abrasions 
for crutch-users. Body lotion and talcum power are two ways to reduce friction, 
but why not take steps to reduce the pain altogether?</P>
<P>One of the best innovations in recent years is glycerin-based gel--you've 
seen this in countless places, from computer mouse pads to bicycle seats. Now 
this soft, squishy gel has been adapted to medical applications including <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344389"" target=""_blank"">comfortable 
crutch arm pads</A>. Slip on one, or a pair, and get instant relief from crutch 
pressure on the underarms.</P>
<H3>Forearm Comfort, Too</H3>
<P>Users of forearm crutches haven't been forgotten. While there is no underarm 
pressure with forearm crutches, friction is focused on the lower arm region. 
Pillowy <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344389"" target=""_blank"">gel-based 
pads for forearm crutches</A> provide cooling relief and let forearm crutch 
users get mobile again with maximum comfort.</P>
<H3>Hand Pressure Nearly Eliminated</H3>
<P>Second to the underarms, pressure on the hands is the next biggest complaint. 
The hand-grip on crutches is not there merely to keep the patient from dropping 
the crutch: it carries weight, too. And crutch carrying weight is not static; it 
is dynamic and variable. Weight alternates between the underarms and the hands 
to different degrees. A variety of <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344389"" target=""_blank"">cloth 
and gel-based hand pads</A> help to absorb much of the shock associated with 
hand-grip pressure. </P>
<H3>Put Slippage Problems on Ice</H3>
<P>If you live in colder areas, you know that it's nearly impossible to walk 
with crutches in snow and ice. It's hard enough to walk with two feet--not to 
mention an extra third or fourth foot! Most crutch tips are designed only for 
optimal conditions, such as dry, flat pavement. A great gadget that screws right 
on in seconds is <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344389"" target=""_blank"">crutch 
ice cleats</A>. The best thing about crutch ice cleats--they don't have to be 
unscrewed after you enter dry surfaces. Just flip them up and it's safe to walk 
inside without scratching floors.</P>

Verilux full spectrum desk lamps set the standard for natural, ""daylight"" lighting. The entire line of Verilux desk lamps use full spectrum light to enhance the clarity and contrast of reading materials, projects, craft and task work. Full spectrum light improves vision while reducing eyestrain and fatigue. In addition, our patented flicker-free ballast and Optix™ glare control filter are unique in the industry, delivering daylight intensity, full spectrum light, without glare.

The best light for reading, tasks, artwork, crafting or other detail work is bright, natural, and glare free. Full spectrum light achieves this by delivering the ""full"" or ""natural"" light spectrum to your eye. Typical incandescent bulbs produce light only from the ""warmer"" red, yellow and orange parts of the visual spectrum, while completely missing the ""cooler"" colors of the blue portion of the spectrum. Unfortunately for society at large, this has resulted in a general acceptance of poor, yellowish light as the ""norm"" in homes and workplaces alike.",,"Verilux Desk Lamps","Desk lamps with full spectrum light to enhance the clarity and contrast of reading materials, projects, craft and task work.","New",,"The Wright Stuff, Inc."

<p>You have a patient, spouse, or parent who needs help in the bathroom--a lot 
of help. It's your job to help them with toilet activities, getting in and 
out of the shower or bath, shampooing, brushing teeth, shaving, and more. </p>
<p>You've been doing this for awhile and know the ropes pretty well. But 
we want to introduce a few assistive devices that you might not be aware 
of--that can make your job easier and your patient or spouse's life more 
rewarding and enjoyable.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911684"" target=""_blank"">Did You 
Know About: No-Rinse Body Wash and Shampoo?</a></h3>
<p>You already know that bath time is difficult. You want to use copious 
amounts of water to help your patient or parent get cleaner, but they are 
understandably reluctant. It's not that they don't want to be clean; not 
at all. It's the feeling and sound of running water, and the changes in 
temperature, that often make them feel uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Did you know that you can substitute some of their baths with
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911684"" target=""_blank"">no-rinse 
shampoo and body bath</a>? These products clean the skin and hair quite 
well, but without the added step of rinsing. When finished, massage the 
product out with a clean, dry towel.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911684"" target=""_blank"">Did You 
Know About: Specialized Body Scrubbers?</a></h3>
<p>Before you say anything: no, we're not talking about just any old 
scrubber. We're talking about a vast array of
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911684"" target=""_blank"">brushers, 
washers, and handles for practically any bathing purpose</a>. There are 
two-sided bath brushes: brush on one side, soap on the other. There 
are U-shaped back scrubbers to get the most hard-to-reach spots. There are 
even under-toe washers. Whatever the purpose, whatever the part of the 
body, chances are you will find a brush or scrubber for it.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911758"" target=""_blank"">Did You 
Know About: Toilet Tissue Holders?</a></h3>
<p>These aren't the holders attached to the wall next to the toilet. No, 
these are clever, hygienic assistive devices that allow the person to grasp 
toilet tissue more easily while wiping. They will appreciate ease and 
comfort--not to mention the privacy--that these toilet tissue holders allow.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911759"" target=""_blank"">Did You 
Know About: Eye Drop Assistants?</a></h3>
<p>Your spouse, parent, or patient may experience redness or dryness in their 
eyes. They would like to use eyedrops but they find it too difficult to 
both squeeze the bottle and to guide the drops to their eyes.
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911759"" target=""_blank"">Squeezers</a>

With this stabilizing bar, a wheelchair can be pushed with one hand. The ergonomic design also allows the person pushing to place their hands in a variety of positions. When using both hands, the Easy Wheelchair Push Bar transfers power directly to the chair with less effort. This helps to make maneuvering steep ramps, inclines, uneven surfaces, soft ground, or carpets much easier.

Children and the elderly will find that a wheelchair equipped with the Easy Wheelchair Push Bar is much easier to push and control. Very tall people and people with lower back pain will be able to stand straighter when pushing a wheelchair with the Easy Push Bar.

The Easy Wheelchair Push Bar is available in two sizes: Kit 1 fits wheelchairs with hand grips from 12 to 19 inches wide; Kit 2 fit hand grips 17 to 26 inches wide.

engrouwiadga,"engrouwiadga",,,No,,,No,"articles","Usually ships the next business day",,"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/makinglifeeasier/",,,,"articles",,"Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Daily Living Aids To Make Life Easier:Garden Tools",No,,,"<p>How do tend to a garden if you have arthritis, are elderly, or otherwise are 
mobility-impaired? It's one thing to overcome indoor obstacles like 
reaching toilet paper on a high shelf; but it's quite another thing to lift big 
bags of mulch, kneel in dirt, and hoe weeds.</p>
<p>First thing, you need to completely change your way of thinking about garden 
tools. Traditional garden tools are inappropriate for people who must deal 
with hand and finger discomfort, as well as for those with mobility challenges. 
The solution is to seek out garden tools made just for such a situation. 
In fact, after using some of these tools for awhile, you may wonder why you ever 
used the ""classic"" type of garden tools in the past!</p>
<h3>The 90-Degree Handle for a More Comfortable Grip</h3>
<p>The key to any ergonomic tool is the ninety-degree angled grip. Most 
gardening tools, such as the shovel, trowel, hoe, cultivator, and others, 
provide a gripping surface that runs in a straight line from the tool head to 
your hands. This means that you must adjust your hands to conform to the 
tool. Twisting your hands, wrists, and arms in a linear fashion usually 
results in pain.</p>
<p>By contrast, the ergonomic garden tool conforms to you. The key element 
is a short handle that rests at a ninety-degree angle, or perpendicular, to the 
garden tool shaft. This allows you to grip the handle with one hand in a 
natural upright position.</p>
<p>You will find <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/chrisspec.html"">trowels, 
cultivators, hoes, and forks</a> with just such a smart design. If you 
don't want to give up your traditional linear-shaft garden tools, you can even 
buy <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/chrisspec.html"">add-on grips</a> that 
turn these into ergonomic tools.</p>
<h3>The Support Cuff for Added Stability</h3>
<p>One other aspect of ergonomic garden tools is the support cuff. 
Available for many types of garden tools, this support cuff works in conjunction 
with the 90-degree handle mentioned above.</p>
<p>The support cuff is positioned behind the 90-degree handle, allowing you to 
slip your forearm through the cuff. You now have two points of stability: 
the cuff and the 90-degree handle. </p>
<p>Called the <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/chrisspec.html"">Easi Grip Cuff</a>, 
it is an add-on feature that slides onto the back of any compatible
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/chrisspec.html"">Easi Grip garden tool</a>.</p>
<h3>Soft, Non-Slip Grips</h3>
<p>Classic garden tools have wooden handles or perhaps even hard plastic 
handles. The core feature of ergonomic garden tools is the
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/chrisspec.html"">soft, non-slip grip</a> that 
absorbs sweat and conforms to your hand.</p>
<h3>Extra-Long Garden Tool Shafts</h3>
<p>Finally, for gardeners who cannot quite reach their intended target, there 
are garden tools with extended shafts.
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/chrisspec.html"">Cultivators, hoes, trowels, 
and forks </a>are available with long shafts between 31"" and 34"" which allow a 
gardener to sit on a <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/chrisspec.html"">garden 
seat caddy</a> or on the ground and tend to plants from a distance.</p>

Using the ergonomic <b>EzGrip® ResQ Gel Pen</b> is a unique experience -- not only for its writing abilities – described as “…floating on paper,” but having the distinction as a pen that cradles and conforms to your extended finger and tip. Only the slightest touch of that one first finger tip is needed to provide downward writing pressure. Like touching a computer key – but lighter. The other fingers can just ""go along for the ride."" It’s not the usual everyday writing experience, but one more comfortable and advanced.

The gel ink is closest to fountain pen ink or rollerball in it's writing characteristics. It flows smoothly, and dries quickly.

By using the EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen, it’s possible to never again get writer’s cramp – never again contemplate the onset of any ""Itis"" – Tendonitis, Arthritis… or repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI’s) such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In practical terms it also means that even having those conditions will not matter. Their mechanisms or weaknesses will not enter into the writing process. The EzGrip pen is often called the ""miracle pen"" for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping. It neutralizes hand difficulties immediately.

<b>Here’s How:</b>
Using the EzGrip ergonomic pen as described, the built-in mechanisms within our hands and arms that create those weaknesses are actually disconnected or bypassed.

The patented EzGrip enables the individual to switch positions, relying on other fingers. Many of us write in personal ways – with different finger holds. The EzGrip allows users to switch fingers at any time to adapt to their individual style of writing. More specifically, the side of the thumb can be used for downward writing pressure – even the middle finger knuckle. There is no incorrect way to hold and use an EzGrip. It’s your choice. And it's a choice that can save you pain and discomfort.

For many families, Alzheimer’s means a gradually diminishing quality of life both for the sufferer and caregivers. All too often, the disease has led to isolation—and even a certain social stigma. It can impose psychological and emotional burdens just as heavy as the physical one. 

The Family Guide to Alzheimer’s Disease was created to help families understand what to expect; deal effectively with the challenge of this disease; help their loved ones meet each day more successfully; and enhance the quality of life for all involved.

Understanding Alzheimer's, Volume 1, 62 minutes 

In this volume you’ll learn about the nature of Alzheimer’s, its causes and the stages of the disease. You’ll also learn some of the typical symptoms, how to obtain a diagnosis and the current treatments. Finally, you’ll learn how the disease affects our loved ones and alters the reality in which they live. Volume one covers: 
   • Overview of Dementia/Alzheimer’s Disease 
   • Symptoms 
   • Diagnosis 
   • Stages of Alzheimer's 
   • Treatment 
   • Telling Others 
   • Patient perspective

Behavior Issues, Volume 2, 67 minutes 

Alzheimer’s changes almost everything about the way our loved ones perceive the world—and how they respond to it. One of the keys to helping our loved ones continue to live as successfully as possible is to understand this changed, strange world. In this volume you’ll learn more about how Alzheimer’s affects our loved ones—and how those effects typically change the person’s behavior. You’ll also learn successful strategies for “redirecting” that behavior in ways that help your loved one and your family enjoy a better quality of life. Volume two covers:    • Overview 
   • Agitation 
   • Hallucinations 
   • Wandering 
   • Sleeplessness/Sundowning    • Incontinence 
   • Inappropriate Actions 
   • Redirection 
   • Fiblets 

Daily Life, Volume 3, 42 minutes 

As you come to understand more about the altered world of an Alzheimer’s sufferer, you’ll learn effective strategies for making your home environment a safe place where your loved one can live successfully. You’ll also learn key skills for communicating with persons suffering from Alzheimer’s and how to create a daily routine that is nurturing for your loved one and manageable for you. Volume three covers: 
   • Home Environment 
   • Driving 
   • Adult Emotions 
   • Communication 
   • Daily Routine

Family Caregiving, Volume 4, 62 minutes 

In this volume, you’ll learn how to handle the daily responsibilities of caring for a loved one, such as eating, dressing, grooming and bathing. Just as important, you’ll learn how to get the outside help from family, friends and other resources that can be critical for safeguarding your own health. Volume four covers:    • Role of the Caregiver 
   • Taking Care of Yourself 
   • Accepting Support 
   • Respite 
   • Sexual Relationships      • Family Relationships 
   • Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) 
   • Eating 
   • Bathing 
   • Dressing 

Transitions, Volume 5, 44 minutes 

In this final volume, you’ll learn how to make some difficult transitions. You’ll learn how to adapt social activities to accommodate your loved one’s increasing disability and isolation. You’ll also learn how to recognize when the time has come to consider moving your loved one to a care facility (and how to evaluate these facilities). You’ll learn how the disease affects a person’s spirituality, and you’ll gain insights from others who have gone through the process of grieving the loss of a loved one for whom they have provided years of care. Volume five covers: 
   • Social Activities 
   • Spiritual Issues 
   • Care Facilities 
   • Grief

you are well aware that these assistive devices don't exactly come with a lot of 
bells and whistles. You are provided with the bare minimum needed to get 
around--and sometimes not even the bare minimum! </p>
<p>We have bundled 5 upgrade packages that wheelchair, scooter, or walker users 
will enjoy:</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">Package 1: The 
Late-Night Walker User</a></h3>
<p>Walkers are difficult enough to use during daylight hours, much less at 
night. That's why any walker user who ever stays out past dark with 
friends, relatives, or out to the library or meetings, will enjoy a set of
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">super-bright LED lights</a> for 
the walker, along with <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">soft hand 
grips</a> for safety and any number of
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">carry-all pouches</a> that neatly 
attach to the walker.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/whac.html"">Package 2: The 
Wheelchair or Scooter User Who Loves to Cook</a></h3>
<p>When you're at the supermarket, those groceries pile up fast. Before 
you know it, you've got a lapful of cans, veggies, and fruits. Take those 
items off your hands and lap with a selection of big carry-all bags made just for 
at-home gourmet cooks. The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/whac.html"">
wheelchair backpack</a> carries a large quantity of groceries, or you can choose 
a <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/whac.html"">giant seatback bag</a> big 
enough to carry everything needed for a six-person feast. For that long 
haul back and forth to the store, add an
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/whac.html"">extra-cushy seat cushion</a> made 
especially for wheelchairs.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/scac.html"">Package 3: The 
Out-All-Day Scooter User</a></h3>
<p>You like to get out, and your scooter is just the thing for that. But 
it's not made for long, extended trips. One great way to lengthen your 
days out is to add a bright, <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/scac.html"">
visible folding flag</a> for safety when crossing streets, a
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/scac.html"">deluxe cupholder</a> for those 
mid-afternoon coffee breaks, and a
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/scac.html"">cane or crutch carrier </a>so 
that you can get out and walk.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/whpoai.html"">Package 4: The 
Extra-Comfort Wheelchair Package</a></h3>
<p>The person who designed the wheelchair must have been thinking more about 
practicality than comfort. Wheelchair users, raise your level of comfort 
by upgrading with an <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/whpoai.html"">extra-soft 
synthetic fur seat</a>, along with
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/whpoai.html"">leg and foot huggers</a> to 
keep limbs comfortably on the chair, and
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/whpoai.html"">wing backs</a> to position your 
torso securely and firmly on the chair.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">Package 5: The Book 
Lover Walker User</a></h3>
<p>Library and bookstore carpeting is not conducive to walker movement: 
those rubber tips tend to catch on carpeting and cause users to stumble. 
Upgrade to a set of <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">walker glides 
or ""skis"" </a>that easily pop on and allow you to slide the walker along. 
For that extended walk, your hands will appreciate extra-comfortable
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">hand grips</a>. And to 
carry all those books home, <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">
carry-all bags</a> ranging from small to super-large, are just the ticket.</p>

Arthritic Aids Are Not Just About Wheelchairs</h3>
<p>In fact, arthritis is not just about discomfort associated with mobility. 
Persons with arthritis often have trouble with some daily tasks that seem 
commonplace:
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53713"" target=""_blank"">cooking and 
eating meals</a>;
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53724"" target=""_blank"">bathing</a>;
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53724"" target=""_blank"">grooming</a>; 
and <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53724"" target=""_blank"">getting 
dressed</a>. Arthritic aids not only ease the pain, but they allow persons 
with arthritis to join in with everyday activities enjoyed by other people who 
are not suffering from arthritis.</p>
<h3>2. Arthritic Aids Don't Have to Be Beige and Ugly</h3>
<p>That's an outdated notion. Over 46 million Americans--one in five--have 
doctor-diagnosed arthritis. Imagine that you're sitting in a movie theater 
with 100 people; over 20 of those people would have arthritis. As a 
result, manufacturers of arthritic aids are compelled to produce stylish and 
technically sophisticated aids for a mass market. How about a full line of
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/62687"" target=""_blank"">ergonomically 
correct and attractive garden tools</a>? Or
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/911617"" target=""_blank"">wireless 
personal pagers</a> that instantly call for help--yet look good on the 
nightstand?</p>
<h3>3. The Range of Arthritic Aids is Surprising</h3>
<p>It's not 
until you start having problems opening jars and lids that you discover an 
amazingly
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/911539"" target=""_blank"">wide range of 
openers</a> for every need. And who would even know that there are
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/62687"" target=""_blank"">garden spray 
bottles that are battery-operated</a> and that don't hurt your hand and wrist?</p>
<h3>4. There are Arthritic Aids for Even Seemingly Trivial Tasks</h3>
<p>It's only the non-arthritic person who believes that eating off of a plate 
isn't a problem for an arthritic person. That's why manufacturers make 
products even as seemingly trivial as a
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461169"" target=""_blank"">plate with a 
lipped edge</a>. And just wait until you have arthritis before saying that
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/911568"" target=""_blank"">zipping a 
zipper or buttoning a button</a> is easy for arthritics.</p>
<h3>5. Even Wheelchairs Get the Special Treatment</h3>
<p>A wheelchair is no longer just a wheelchair when it's got a
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">nifty 
backpack that attaches to the rear</a> to carry groceries or books. For 
users of walkers, there are
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">special 
glides</a> for the tips--you can even snap on a
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">set of skis</a>! 
Add a set of <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">
super-bright LED lights and a pouch for the back</a>, and they'll start calling 
you a speed demon!</p>

the doctor by 10:30. The person would rather do it by themselves--if they 
could. They want to; they are motivated. But they simply aren't 
physically able. </p>
<p>So think of yourself as the assistant. Put yourself in the mindset that 
they are the ones doing the moving; you're there just to help.</p>
<p>Of course, helpers need all the help they can get. This is why we have 
mapped out your journey from the bedroom to the doctor's office--with a few 
assistive products along the way.</p>

Freedom Dinnerware non skid dishes were designed for people with hand tremors, paralysis, Parkinson's disease, arthritis, uncontrolled movement and disabilities that restrict hand movement necessary for eating independently. Extended rims, built in dividers, special scoop angles and the patented no slip suction pad base provide the solution to the problem.

Freedom Dinnerware is ideal for young children, helping them to eat and drink independently and at the same time reducing accidental spills.

The products are suitable for Nurseries, Playgroups, Kindergarten and for use in the Home.

In addition they reduce labor cost and time by helping to eliminate spills, laundry cleaning and damage to equipment, bedding and flooring.

Each one of the Freedom Dinnerware non skid divided compartment plates come with a Freedom no slip Suction Pad. Simply turn the Freedom Dinnerware divided compartment plate over and attach the Freedom no slip Pad to the bottom of the Freedom Dinnerware divided compartment plate, like putting a lid on a jar and turn it by hand until it is securely tight. Freedom Dinnerware divided plates are ready for use.

The Freedom Suction no slip Pad is a patented vacuum system. When you place the Freedom Dinnerware non skid divided compartment plate with pad attached, on a flat surface and push down with slight pressure , it creates a suction system that holds the non skid Freedom Divided Plate in place and will not move if you bump it or hit it. Perfect for flat table tops, boats, RVs, wheelchair trays and over-bed tables. No more suction cup feet that slide and loose their grip.

The head is 9 inches long and has a slight curve to it to allow for proper reach. The head also has four ""fingers"" that extend out of the wand with the slide of a button. As they extend, they open to hold a shaver, sponge, ointment pad, tissue wad or other items. 

When sliding the button back, the fingers go back into the wand, securing it in place and giving a tight grip, strength and a smooth end. To release an item, just push and slide the button back. It is that easy! The rinse hold in the head helps aid with cleaning in case any soil should get in the wand. 

<b>The Extension:</b>

The extension is a 6½ inch piece. When combined with the head and the handle, the wand becomes 21 inches long. If a shorter wand is desired, the head and the handle can be put together without the extension for a length of 14 inches. Both the extension and the handle have quick and easy release buttons. 

<b>The Handle:</b>

The handle is approximately 8 inches long. It is contoured for ease in holding and has a soft secure grip to eliminate slipping. It also has a loop on the end so that you can hang it in a convenient spot.

fuinmewlihe,"fuinmewlihe",,,No,,,No,"articles","Usually ships the next business day",,"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/makinglifeeasier/",,,,"articles",,"Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Caregiver Articles and Information:In The Kitchen",No,,,"<p>Your patient, spouse, or parent has difficulties with self-feeding because of 
arthritis, stroke, or other ailments. They enjoy mealtimes considerably 
more when they can do it independently. You would like to help. How 
can you do this?</p>
<p>The fact is, folks who cannot manage mealtimes independently need help <i>to 
help themselves</i>. Ordinary tableware, plates, mugs, glasses, and most 
dining implements are not appropriate for people who have such difficulties. 
As a caregiver, the best way you can help is to give these people the proper tools so that they can 
dine independently.</p>
<h3>A Bib Means Self-Feeding Freedom</h3>
<p>Of all the assistive dining implements, the bib is often the most difficult 
one to present to the patient. After all, many people view
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911641"" target=""_blank"">dining bibs</a> 
as necessary only for the neediest people--the ones who are 
least able to take care of themselves.</p>
<p>The flaw in this argument is that many folks who need bibs actually <i>
prefer</i> bibs. Bibs allow the person to feed him or herself without fear 
of dropping food and soiling their clothing. This grants them freedom to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Try new types of food.</li>
	<li>Enjoy ""staining"" food that they might ordinarily avoid--berries, dark 
	juices, marinara sauces, etc.</li>
	<li>Attempt more self-feeding, rather than falling back on the ""safety net"" 
	of a caregiver.</li>
	<li>Take larger bites.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adaptive Plates and Bowls for Sure Control</h3>
<p>Assistive dinnerware is often welcomed with open arms by people weary of food 
not remaining on their plates or of spoons and forks that don't stay put. 
Assistive dinnerware consists of so many helpful types of adapted plates, forks, 
bowls, and mugs that we will give you a breakdown here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911594"" target=""_blank"">Scooper 
Plates</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911594"" target=""_blank"">Scoopers</a> 
are plates that have rims or narrow lips along the edges that allow people to 
push food onto forks or spoons without fear of the food falling off the edge.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911594"" target=""_blank"">
Partitioned Dinnerware</a></p>
<p>For people tired of eating mixed-up food,
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911594"" target=""_blank"">partitioned 
plates</a> typically offer three large partitions within the same plate to keep 
food separate.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911661"" target=""_blank"">Non-Skid 
Dinnerware</a></p>
<p>It's not just the food that has a tendency to move around; the plates, too, 
can slide. Non-skid dinnerware consists either of specially adapted
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911661"" target=""_blank"">plates and 
bowls with suction bases</a> or regular dinnerware atop a
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911661"" target=""_blank"">non-skid pad</a>.</p>
<h3>Better Control with Liquids</h3>
<p>Liquids, especially hot liquids like tea, coffee, or cocoa, are an area of 
special concern to people who have difficulties dining independently. 
Spilling liquids almost always results in a huge mess. In the case of hot 
liquids, serious injury can result. </p>
<p>Assistive beverage implements include
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911662"" target=""_blank"">cupholders</a> 
that attach bedside or to the wheelchair,
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911662"" target=""_blank"">extra-long 
reusuable straws</a>, and
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911662"" target=""_blank"">straw holders</a> 
to keep the straw firmly vertical and in one spot. </p>

funandgawiar,"funandgawiar",,,No,,,No,"articles","Usually ships the next business day",,"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/makinglifeeasier/",,,,"articles",,"Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Arthritis Daily Living Aids:Around the House",No,,,"<p>Too often, persons with arthritis view arthritic aids as being purely 
functional, practical, and--let's face it--boring. It's all well and good 
to have aids that help you easily turn on lights, move safely into the bathtub, 
and button a blouse. But what about fun and pleasure? Does arthritis 
mean sitting alone in a chair every night, reading old magazines?</p>
<p>No. As a matter of fact, arthritic persons who engage in regular fun 
activities, especially sociable activities, develop healthier patterns of 
living; as a result, their pain and discomfort may be diminished.</p>
<p>So why not call up a couple of friends for some iced tea and a few hands of 
pinochle? Or, depending on your inclinations, beer and poker? 
Whichever way you swing, you'll need a little help along the way.</p>
<h3>Getting the Food and Drinks Ready--Double-Time</h3>
<p>It shouldn't take you forever to prepare the beverages and snacks in the 
kitchen. And it certainly isn't supposed to cause you pain and discomfort. 
So, you'll want to have some
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53713"" target=""_blank"">arthritic 
kitchen aids</a> handy to smooth the process. Open up the salsa with 
adapted jar openers, draw water for the tea with super-grippy silicone grips 
that easily grab faucet handles. There are specially adapted &quot;lipped&quot; 
plates so that no food slides off the plate, and cupholders and straws for your 
margaritas. </p>
<h3>Where are the Playing Cards?</h3>
<p>Time is ticking, and guests will be here at seven o'clock. You've got 
the snacks out, bar or tea service set up, but you're missing the playing cards. 
You knew they were here somewhere. </p>
<p>On the games shelf in the hall closet? Of course not. In the 
miscellaneous drawer, along with your tape measures and pens? No, it 
couldn't be that easy. Under a sofa?</p>
<p>Then, flash--a vision of your three year-old grandson tossing the pack of 
cards on top of the TV cabinet. We've got a problem here, Houston: 
TV cabinet is six feet tall. You're five feet, two inches in socks--not to 
mention the arthritis! </p>
<p>Instead of doing the dangerous and impossible thing--standing on top of a 
rickety stack of books--you simply snatch the pack of cards off the TV cabinet 
with your <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461285"" target=""_blank"">
lightweight, nimble-fingered grabber</a>. Easy as pie.</p>
<h3>Time to Play Cards</h3>
<p>Guests are here and you've loosened them up with a few drinks. Now it's 
time to beat the pants off of them. Separate them from their poker 
chips--or at least, their pride--with a great selection of
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/911473"" target=""_blank"">playing cards 
and card holders</a> made especially for arthritic persons. These cards 
are big and easy to handle. Should you need a rest, card holders assist 
you with single or multiple hands. And in the event, someone at the table 
has trouble seeing, as an added bonus these cards all have 
extra-sized numbers, letters, and faces.</p>

everyday tasks within the house is one thing; but doing tasks <i>outside of the 
house</i> is quite another thing.</p>
<p>After all, the house is one's personal, unique environment. It can be 
molded, shaped, and controlled to suit one's needs. If a light switch 
cannot be reached, extensions are available to lengthen one's grasp. If 
the tub is slippery, grab bars and other stability aids may be added to the tub 
to make a person feel safer.</p>
<p>But outside of the house, it's a different matter. Folks who may have 
trouble with mobility may feel that they are at the mercy of exterior 
environments. In one sense, this is understandable. A person can't 
go around adding assistive devices to public buildings! But a person can 
bring along their own assistive devices.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/baoponsp.html"">An Extra Hand Out in the 
Garden</a></h3>
<p>If you would like to spend the day in the garden, you know that hand-operated 
garden sprayers are just plain difficult to operate. The answer is
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/baoponsp.html"">battery-powered sprayers</a>. 
One easy touch lets you adjust from a mist to a stream, and they spray as far as 
fourteen feet to those plants that are out of the way.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/keyturners.html"">Help with Locking the 
Door</a></h3>
<p>If you're really going out on the town, the first order of business is to lock 
the door behind you. Keys can be incredibly difficult to turn. 
Factor in other problems like rusty deadbolts, cold weather, and ice, and you 
may find yourself entertaining the idea of leaving the door unlocked. But 
this is not an option. Instead,
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/keyturners.html"">key turners</a> help you 
grip the key and provide up to 300% more turning leverage.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/gascapwrench.html"">Gas Up and Get on the 
Road</a></h3>
<p>Maybe you have no problem with driving except for one thing--opening up the 
gas cap. Since the days of smiling gas attendants are long gone, you can 
use a <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/gascapwrench.html"">gas cap wrench </a>
to smoothly unscrew the cap. ""Wrench"" is really a misnomer, since this 
smart, T-shaped assistive device is <i>specially made for gas caps</i>, fits 
perfectly over the entire gas cap head, and tucks neatly away in your glove 
compartment when not in use.</p>
<h3>Meeting Friends or Hitting the Stacks?</h3>
<p>It doesn't matter whether you are meeting friends for a game of pinochle, 
poker, or bridge, cards are easy to hold with
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/plcaandho.html"">hands-free card holders</a>, 
and super-easy to see with extra-large letters and numbers. If you're 
going to the library or bookstore instead, those brand-new bestsellers are much 
easier to crack open and hold with a
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/roboho.html"">book holder</a>. Extend 
your arm to reach that latest John Grisham or Danielle Steele novel with the 
help of <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/reachingaids.html"">lightweight 
reachers</a>. Can't find what you're looking for, but hate using the 
library computer because of limited finger mobility or discomfort?
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/typeaid.html"">Type aids are neat slide-on 
assistive devices</a> which help you to push computer keys without using even a 
single finger.</p>

Key lever: Older Americans with dexterity problems can have a hard time turning the key in a lock. The lever allows locks to be opened easily and quickly without finger or wrist pain. Up to four standard keys can be inserted and stored into the four arms. 

""Many elder adults are bothered by wrist pain and more commonly lose their sensation in their fingertips,"" says Joy, ""so the simple process of turning a key n a lock [which we do every day] can be difficult. Using the key lever reduces pain and aggravation.""

The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/keyturners.html"" target=""_blank"">KEY TURNER</a> is ideal for people with limited hand strength or coordination. These heavy-duty key turners provide increased leverage to turn a key with a comfortable grip. Fold keys into handle when not in use.

Ring pen: Handling a pen is something that can be difficult and tiring for people with arthritis and other dexterity problems. The ring pen is an ergonomically correct designed pen that helps make it easier for these people to write. The index finger slips through a hole in the pen and offers a place for the writing finger to be rested while writing. The ring pen removes pressure from the wrist and joints while writing. 

""Many of us take for granted the process of handling a pen,"" says Joy. ""Elder adults, again, have difficulty using a pen because of arthritis or loss of sensation. Using a ring pen removes the pressure from the wrist and joints allowing you to write all day long.""

The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/writingaids.html"" target=""_blank"""">NEO BIRD WRITING PEN</a> is a great relief for people with arthritis or hand ailments or injuries. The unique, patented design of this innovation in writing instruments allows the weight of your hand to work for you, not against you.

Nearly 10% of the public suffers from this form of depression when deprived of precious sunshine. Now, the original <b>Verilux HappyLight</b> can be yours – delivering a full 10,000 LUX of indoor light therapy without any harmful UV rays. And it can be hung on a wall or set on a table or counter for your morning sunshine bath.

Research Findings:

Follow-up Study shows 94% of patients stopped using anti-depressant drugs. While correct diagnosis of SAD has become more commonplace, treatment is the area where doctors and SAD sufferers need more education. In the past, doctors have been quick to prescribe an anti-depressant (like Prozac, Paxil or Zoloft) when a patient mentioned being “depressed”. While drugs can sometimes be effective treating depression, they also have a well documented history of very serious side-effects. Light therapy is the natural, side-effect free alternative to anti-depressant pills.

To illustrate, a 1997 research study titled “Follow-up study of seasonal affective disorder in Switzerland”, conducted at the Psychiatric University Clinic, Basel, Switzerland, concluded that:

“Over a number of years, the clinical diagnosis changed for the better in 64% of the patients… and that light therapy (and perhaps also light-oriented behaviour) reduced the incidence and depth of subsequent depressive episodes. Further evidence for this was the large reduction in use of conventional antidepressant drugs (from 17 to 1) during the follow-up period. Diagnosis of SAD was stable and reliable.”

Then you know it’s not easy to stay connected across the miles. Oh, sure, everything seemed doable in the beginning with the help of romantic phone calls, gifts, greeting cards and weekend visits; but as time went on, the blush of romance faded as the day-to-day logistics of managing the relationship from far away slowly got the best of you.
Now, picture the lovers as aging parents and their out-of-town children and grandchildren. As we go about doing whatever it takes to make time for each other—from making weekly calls to juggling multiple personal and professional calendars, to struggling to arrange to be physically there—we’re back in the same boat (without the lure of lust and roses). Thanks to the times we live in and the wonders of technology, it’s becoming easier to maintain family ties with elderly relatives in spite of the miles that come between us. The world is changing, and more changes will come in the future, influencing the way we relate as family. To jump-start the process of staying in touch through the use of technology, here are some of my favorite high-tech ideas from my book, The Complete Eldercare Planner:

Arthritis sufferers don’t have to be limited to warming up bland frozen meals in the microwave.","Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Arthritis Daily Living Aids:In The Kitchen",No,,,"<h2>You Bet--With Specially Adapted Knives, Utensils, and Plates Just for Arthritics</h2>
<p>The kitchen presents many obstacles to arthritis sufferers.  The easiest tasks often become so difficult that arthritics end up cooking foods that they didn’t really want—only because these substitute meals were easier to fix.</p>
<p>More often than not, packaging is the culprit.  Turn-resistant caps and lids are notorious for putting roadblocks between arthritics and food or liquid.  But often the food itself is the problem.  Cutting, chopping, and slicing are tasks that many arthritis sufferers can only dream about.</p> 
<p>That shouldn’t be so.  Let’s consider a tasty lasagna dinner and see how arthritics can prepare it—easily, quickly, and painlessly.</p>
<h3>Preparing the Lasagna Dinner with Adapted Knives</h3>
The secret to any savory lasagna is garlic and onions.  And any experienced cook should know that the finer the garlic and onions are chopped, the richer the taste.  Some chopping can be done with electric food processors, but is it worth pulling out and cleaning a machine to chop 2 cloves of garlic and a half-cup of onions?  Anyway, lasagna is a hands-on meal if ever there were any. </p>
<p>Instead, use a knife!  Many arthritics balk at using knives because of the discomfort or pain involved.  In fact, arthritics may choose from a <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461262"" target=""_blank"">wide variety of adapted knives</a> that make slicing, chopping, and cutting as easy—and safe—for them as for any non-arthritic cook. </p> 
<p>Homemade lasagna sauce typically uses plain tomato sauce as a base.  Or, you can shortcut the homemade process by using prepared spaghetti sauce.  Either way, you still have to contend with the formidable task of opening a can or jar.  Well, this is no longer formidable.  In fact, it’s downright easy with <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/911539"" target=""_blank"">adapted kitchen openers</a> for arthritics:  from simple and inexpensive silicone jar openers to sophisticated and durable wall-mount openers. </p>
<h3>Enjoying the Fruits of Your Work with Adapted Eating Utensils and Plates</h3>
<p>Now that the lasagna is made—and hopefully accompanied by a salad, bread, and a glass of red wine—the only thing left to do is eat.  It’s frustrating for many arthritic 
persons to go to all the work of cooking an elaborate meal, only to be slowed down or stopped dead in one’s tracks when it comes time to eat.</p>
<p>Ever notice how slippery lasagna can be?  Something about that combination of lasagna noodles and sauce makes for a difficult eating experience for many arthritics.  However, arthritis sufferers can eat with the same level of enjoyment and pace as their fellow diners.    <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461198"" target=""_blank"">Adapted eating utensils</a> range from super-grippy knives, spoons, and forks with silicone handles, to other utensils that employ comfortable clips, straps, and cuffs to aid one’s grip. </p>
<p>This slippery pasta also has a way of sliding off the plate—in the opposite direction of one’s fork!  <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461169"" target=""_blank"">Specially adapted plates and bowls</a> make it easy for arthritis sufferers to keep that savory lasagna on the plate, and to eat it while it’s still warm and delicious.</p>
<p>So, the answer to the question is a resounding “No!”  Arthritis sufferers don’t have to be limited to warming up bland frozen meals in the microwave—but can enjoy cooking and eating the same tasty, home-cooked meals as anyone else.</p>

Since you're 
both on the same page, why is there a problem?</p>
<p>The issue concerns assistance with bathing and toilet functions. The 
person you are caring for--a patient, a spouse, a mother, or father--honestly 
would rather take care of bathing and toilet tasks independently. You--the 
caregiver--would rather be taking care of other needs. But it is an issue 
because too often there is a gap between what the person <i>can</i> do and what the 
person <i>wants</i> to do.</p>
<p>You can narrow that gap, or even close it, by taking advantage of assistive
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911757"" target=""_blank"">bathing aids</a> 
and <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911758"" target=""_blank"">toiletry 
aids</a>. The trick is to give the person the tools to do these things by 
oneself. </p>
<p>Start with the most sensitive area: the toilet. This is 
universally the one place where people wish to have privacy. You can 
provide that privacy by first identifying needs. How do you identify 
needs? By asking.</p>
<p>Easier said than done, right? At some point, the desire to talk about 
these issues becomes greater than the potential embarrassment. As the 
caregiver, you should be intimately aware of the person's needs--but you still 
must elicit a response from them. It's as simple as saying, ""You know, 
there are <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911758"" target=""_blank"">
toilet tissue aids</a>. They help you hold the tissue yourself. Then 
I wouldn't have to be in there with you.""</p>
<p>If the topic feels too weighty, inject a little humor: ""Then you could 
read your magazine as long as you want, right? You wouldn't have me rushing you 
along!""</p>
<p>Much of the problem stems from one simple fact: they <i>may not even know</i> 
about these assistive devices. How is it possible to ask for a
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911758"" target=""_blank"">tissue tongs</a> 
or <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911758"" target=""_blank"">commode 
pads</a> (soft polymer seat cushions) if one has never even heard of them?</p>
<p>Try to present questions with simple, multiple-choice answers, rather than 
asking them open-ended questions. Don't say, ""How can I make it so you can 
take a shower alone?"" Rather ask, ""I've seen some
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911757"" target=""_blank"">nice shower 
seats</a> advertised that let you take a shower all alone. I would have to 
get you in and out, but you could enjoy the shower by yourself. Would you 
like me to look into it or would you rather not pursue it?""</p>
<p>Once they try out and begin to enjoy some of these assistive devices, they 
may want to go a bit further. You can encourage this. For example, 
the person who learns to take a shower on a seat may become more confident to 
use a <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911757"" target=""_blank"">grab 
bar</a> to get in and out of the shower--thus becoming fully independent.</p>
<p>Since most folks who need toilet or bathing assistance are sensitive to the 
feelings of their caregivers, they may feel that it is too much of a bother to 
you to look into the issue, or they may fear that the cost is too much. 
However, you can assure them that you would enjoy the assistive device, too. If they ask, you might say, ""Because while you are showering, it 
would give me a chance to straighten up your room and perhaps rest my feet for a 
few minutes.""</p>
<p>Communication and education--and keeping a sense of humor--are the keys to 
approaching sensitive toiletry and bathing issues with people you are caring
for.</p>

howtoinheasd,"howtoinheasd",,,No,,,No,"articles","Usually ships the next business day",,"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/makinglifeeasier/",,,,"articles",,"Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Caregiver Articles and Information:Around the House",No,,,"<p>If your husband or wife, patient, or parent has difficulties moving around 
the house, you have first-hand knowledge of some of the things they go through 
just to perform simple tasks. Brushing teeth, shaving, rising in the 
morning--simple things for you can often seem like insurmountable jobs for the 
person you are caring for.</p>
<p>The various ways you can approach this depend, of course, on many different 
factors: their personality and yours, the tasks they wish to accomplish, 
and their environment. However, here is one suggested way to deal with 
this issue:</p>
<h3>1. Identify Basic Needs</h3>
<p>Mobile or not, able or not--we all have the basic tasks we need to do in 
order to get ready for the day. Brushing teeth, shaving, sleeping, eating 
are universal human needs.</p>
<p>But the person you are caring for may not necessarily require help with all 
of those things. Rising from bed may not be a problem, but hand tremors 
may prevent them from brushing teeth or shaving (We suggest:
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45018"" target=""_blank"">weighted 
holders for toothbrushes and razors</a>). Or it could be the opposite 
case, where the person has general weakness which prevents them from rising in 
bed (We suggest:
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45018"" target=""_blank"">bed caddies to 
help them sit up</a>) though hand tremors are not a problem.</p>
<h3>2. Identify Wants and Desires</h3>
<p>After you have taken care of basic needs, you will want to progress to wants 
and desires. It is necessary that a person brush their teeth and bathe, 
but it's not a necessity that they use to the computer to type e-mails to their 
children and grandchildren. However, being able to do so will enrich their 
lives (We suggest:
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45018"" target=""_blank"">a typing aid 
to help them press keys without using their fingers</a>). </p>
<p>Is it absolutely necessary that they be able to write notes on Christmas 
cards with their own hand? Of course not. You or another caregiver 
might be able to help them with that. But for persons with weakened hand 
strength, the ability to do so independently may empower them to do other things 
by alone (We suggest:
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45018"" target=""_blank"">pen assistants 
which hold the pens for them, saving their finger strength</a>). </p>
<p>Eventually, you begin to see that there is a hazy line between needs and 
wants. For many people, some of these ""optional"" assistive devices may 
actually be more important than those devices that help with the basics.</p>
<h3>3. Communicate and Evaluate</h3>
<p>Does it work? Do they like it? Would a different type of 
toothbrush holder be easier to handle? Have they mastered one typing aid 
well enough that they can double their speed with another typing aid?</p>
<p>Communication is the only way to evaluate how well these devices work. 
The person may be putting on a good ""front"" while using a particular device, 
but it may actually not be appropriate for them. Or they may find that a 
different type of assistive device may be better.</p>
<p>Ask questions and listen. No one was born a perfect caregiver; no one 
innately has these skills. These are learned skills (We suggest:
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45018"" target=""_blank"">Educational 
videos to help you learn caregiving</a>) that take time to master. There 
is a learning curve. Remember that patience goes both ways. </p>

persons--or for persons who simply have trouble moving around and dealing with 
the demands of everyday living. After all, the kitchen is the one place 
where fine motor skills, visual acuity, patience, strength, and coordination all 
come together. If any of those skills are not present, the kitchen can be 
an unpleasant and unsafe place. </p>
<p>Perhaps you may have the desire and skills to take on a certain task, such as peeling 
a carrot or chopping an onion. But your hands or eyes may no longer be 
cooperating with you to help you complete the task.</p>
<p>Assistive devices are specially designed to fill in the gap between desire 
and completion. A dazzling array of kitchen assistive devices are 
available to help you with the cutting and peeling needed to cook nearly any 
meal that your heart desires.</p>
<h3>Adapted Knives for Safer Cutting and Chopping</h3>
<p>Do you remember the days when you could pick up any knife and chop up a 
stew's worth of vegetables? Now you can barely pick up a knife to do something as simple as slicing a tomato for a salad.</p>
<p>For the elderly or for persons with physical challenges, knife work rates at 
the top of the list for tasks that are both most necessary and most daunting. 
After all, you're dealing with a tool that can cut through the tough skin of a 
squash; imagine what it could do to a finger! If you have even the 
slightest amount of doubt at tackling kitchen work, you may greatly benefit from
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/inkitchen.html"">kitchen adaptive devices to 
make cutting easier</a>.</p>
<h3>Moving the Knife Handle to Fit the Hand</h3>
<p>Well, why not try readjusting the knife handle? A
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adaptedknives.html"">wonderful line of 
kitchen tools under the Easi-Grip brand name</a> offer handles that are 90 
degrees, or perpendicular, to the cutting blade. With these tools, you can 
hold your hand in a more natural upright fashion, much in the manner you 
might hold a potato masher. And the handles are made of soft-grip plastic.</p>
<p>If you prefer your knives the old-fashioned way--with the grip in line with 
the blade--then you may wish to look at knives that simply have a
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adaptedknives.html"">softer, more ""grippy"" 
handle</a>. </p>
<h3>Rock 'n' Roll in the Kitchen?</h3>
<p>Why not entertain the idea of knives with a different kind of cutting 
surface? Several different types of knives are available that allow you to
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adaptedknives.html"">rock or roll your 
cutting motion</a>, rather than pushing straight down. The ""rockers"" have 
a C-shaped cutting surface that allow you to easily slide through food with 
steadily increasing pressure. The ""rollers"" operate in a similar way, but 
have a cutting surfaces that look much like pizza cutters--though with sharper 
blades.</p>
<h3>Peeling Potatoes the Easy Way</h3>
<p>Peeling potatoes and carrots has to be one of the least enjoyable kitchen 
tasks. Your hands are close to the vegetables or fruits, which means that 
they are in danger of being accidentally sliced. A
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/vegandfruith.html"">veggie and fruit holder</a> 
securely grips the food, while the
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/gogrswpe.html"">ergonomically correct peeler</a> 
with the extra-large rubber hands helps you with the peeling process!</p>

Cue drum 
roll.</P>
<P>Pardon the bad joke. For many people, the cane is an afterthought, a mobility 
aid to be taken advantage of when other aids fail. It's a stopgap. It's a ""first 
mobility aid"" to later be supplanted by ""something better."" It's an aid that's 
the same today as it was ten thousand years ago. It's-- Well, let's come clean 
here--it's associated with old folks and the inability to get around. </P>
<P>Wrong, wrong, and wrong again. The cane has become such a fixture in our 
minds, not to mention our culture, that it's difficult to see it for what it is: 
one of the best mobility aids around. In many cases, it's better than the more 
advanced--and expensive--mobility aids on the market. It's a long-term walking 
solution for a lot of happy people; hardly a stopgap. Because of certain 
technical advances, it's not the same as it was centuries ago--or even ten years 
ago. And the cane has nothing to do with inability. It's all about ability and 
mobility. People of all ages, young and old, who need to get around quickly and 
safely and with a minimum of discomfort, love using a good cane. </P>
<H3>Canes are Elegantly Designed Technological Marvels</H3>
<P>What is a cane? Some kind of primitive walking device that a person would use 
for lack of anything better? Hardly. Long ago, the Greeks determined that the 
column was the strongest engineering element they could build. The column became 
the main support for bridges, temples, and marketplaces. What is the cane if not 
a mobile column? Weight ratings for many <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/45031"" target=""_blank"">adjustable 
canes</A> range in the hundreds of pounds.</P>
<H3>Canes are the Lightest Weight Mobility Aid on the Market</H3>
<P>Compared to wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, or just about any other mobility 
aid, the cane beats them all hands down. Most canes weigh less than a couple of 
pounds, yet support hundreds of pounds of user weight.</P>
<H3>Canes are Green</H3>
<P>No batteries, no emissions. Think the Toyota Prius can beat that?</P>
<H3>Canes are Highly Advanced</H3>
<P>Canes come with a <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/45031"" target=""_blank"">multitude 
of cool gadgets</A> nowadays that help increase comfort and safety, such as 
lights on front and back, ice cleats, clips, and magnetic holders.</P>
<H3>Canes Look Pretty Good</H3>
<P>While it's possible to get the traditional wooden cane, <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/45031"" target=""_blank"">fancy 
aluminum canes</A> have flooded the market recently that have bold and 
multi-colored patterns on them.</P>
<H3>Canes are Reasonably Priced</H3>
<P>Canes are one of the lowest cost mobility aids around, and nearly every 
insurance plan will cover canes.</P>
<H3>Canes are Compact</H3>
<P>This is one of the best-kept secrets. Haven't seen a lot of canes lately? 
That's probably because cane users <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/45031"" target=""_blank"">collapse 
their aluminum canes</A> in four sections and then stow them away in purses, 
book bags, briefcases, or even oversized coat pockets. Now you see them, now you 
don't!</P>
<P>So there you have it. Give the cane a whirl, why don't you?</P>

The Invisia™ Collection is based on a simple concept; GRAB BARS SHOULD NOT LOOK LIKE GRAB BARS. 

In keeping with this concept, HealthCraft has designed a series of luxurious bathroom accessories that also happen to be grab bars hidden in plain sight.

<ul>
<li>A seamless look and feel... Common design elements throughout the entire collection allow for a variety of charming combinations to create a consistent look in any bathroom.</li>
<li>Integrated support rail... Professional grade construction combined with superior quality fittings ensure years of reliable service and rock-solid support.</li>
<li>DuPont™ Corian® surfaces... Beautiful shatterproof surfaces that are nonporous and resist the growth of mold, mildew and bacteria.</li>
<li>Discreet wall stems with concealed screws... Meticulously designed wall interface stems render screws and mounting areas virtually invisible and allow the Invisia™ Collection to naturally blend within its environment.</li>
<li>Multi-contact wall support... While two-point contact with the wall structure is standard for most grab bars and bathroom accessories, much of the Invisia™ Collection overachieves with up to 4 points of contact for maximum structural support.</li>

<p>There are a host of adapted aids to help arthritic persons around the house. 
Many are familiar—from <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53713"" target=""_blank"">special 
kitchen aids</a> like lipped plates to <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53724"" target=""_blank"">grooming and 
bathing aids</a> such as elevated toilet seats and hand grips for the bathtub.</p>
<p>But to many people who suffer from arthritis, the garden is a completely 
different place. Just thinking of the garden may be enough to cause pain 
and discomfort. After all, if it's hard to button a blouse, how could one 
expect to sit in the dirt and trowel the garden?</p>
<h3>Kneeling? Digging? Clever Arthritic Aids to Get You Into the 
Garden</h3>
<p>Arthritic persons often feel more comfortable in the house. After all, 
the house is a controlled environment. No surprises here. The house 
might already be adapted to make it easier to eat, sleep, and bathe. The 
house is safer. As a result, many arthritic persons start to feel cooped up, caged-in...imprisoned.</p>
<p>No wonder. When it's Spring, who wouldn't want to be outside planting 
seeds for flowers? When it's Fall, why not gather leaves? Gardening 
isn't just a difficult task to be surmounted; gardening 
actually helps ease the pain of arthritis.</p>
<p>Yes, a report by ABC News demonstrates that gardening helps with joint 
flexibility and bone density--both essential for people with arthritis. In 
fact, research has shown that gardening develops bone density as well as does 
weight training. Not to mention, being outside in fresh air and sunlight 
provides an added mood boost to arthritic persons accustomed to spending most of their time indoors.</p>
<p>Enter <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/62687"" target=""_blank"">adapted gardening aids</a>, a newer category of arthritic aids developed in response to a more mobile generation of arthritic persons. Have difficulty holding a garden trowel? Manufacturers have designed a new type of trowel that allows you to hold your hand in a natural, upright position--some even with wrist straps for added stability. Sitting and moving around causing you pain in your legs? A neat garden seat caddy will keep you off of your knees--so that you can move from the petunias to the begonias with greater ease and comfort.</p>
<h3>Aids for Indoor Gardening, Too</h3>
<p>Not all gardening happens outside. Potted and hanging plants provide a 
welcome burst of green and bright color to staid indoor environments. Or 
perhaps outdoor gardening, despite all the clever <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/62687"" target=""_blank"">gardening gadgets and tools</a>, is still too difficult for you. Then it's time to tend to the indoor plants.</p>
<p>Before anything, you need to be able to reach the plant or spray bottle. 
Imagine if it's a hanging plant that needs to be turned. Reaching high is 
out of the question.  <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461285"" target=""_blank"">Lightweight 
reachers and grippers</a> are available to help you grasp whatever you need to 
start taking care of your indoor plants.</p>
<p>Once you have taken hold of that water sprayer, how do you expect to pump it without causing hand and wrist pain? It's a snap with inexpensive
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/913952"" target=""_blank"">battery-powered sprayer bottles</a> that work just like the real thing—but better. They spray your plants faster and more evenly than any hand-pump sprayer bottle ever can.</p>
<p>Never let it be said that the garden--whether indoor or outdoor--is off 
limits to arthritic persons. Because of great new advances in arthritic 
aids, arthritic persons can sit, trowel, plant, water, and spray to their 
heart's content.</p>

It is especially helpful for those with early- to mid-stage Alzheimer's or age-related memory loss. 

A typical message might be ""Hi, Mom. Today is Tuesday, you have had a good breakfast and taken all of your medication. Mary is here with you, and I will be back this afternoon."" A message like this, or a simple ""I love you, Mom"", played on demand, can calm and reassure someone who is often anxious and confused. 

The Kind Reminder™ was created by the daughter of someone who is an Alzheimer's patient. It is a recorder specifically designed for people with dementia. It may be worn as a pendant or placed on a nearby table or counter. It is compact, lightweight, and easy to operate - just press the one big visible button to hear a caring message. 

Caregivers can change messages easily and often. They can record messages that anticipate the frustrating, repetitive questions often asked by Alzheimer's patients. This can help reduce caregiver stress. 

The Kind Reminder™ can also comfort and support patients in hospitals and nursing facilities. A recorded personal message from a friend or family member is especially helpful where the primary language of the patient does not match the language of the health care providers. 

<h4>Kind Reminder Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Relieves caregiver frustration - reduces the need for answering frequently-asked questions.</li>

MediBeads are microwave activated wraps that deliver pain relieving moist heat therapy.
<br><br>
MediBeads Wraps are ready for use in just a minute and are applied directly to the site of pain to provide immediate relief. The wraps continue to deliver therapeutic moist heat for up to thirty minutes. This is the medically recommended treatment time for heat therapy within a three to four hour period. 
<br><br>
Through a patent pending process, the OrthoBeads in MediBeads continuously recharge by absorbing only water molecules from the air. Adding water is not necessary. The absorbed water is held, purified and released as ""clean moist heat"" when the MediBeads Wrap is microwaved. The result is a bacteria and odor-free wrap. Unlike other grain and pellet products, MediBeads need no special covers, they will not dry out, dissolve or disintegrate. MediBeads Wraps are washable, so no special covers are required.
<br><br>
When removed from the microwave, the temperature of MediBeads Wrap does not increase. This prevents inadvertent burns, which are caused by the continued temperature increase (""cooking"") prevalent in all gel packs. Microwave activation eliminates potentially dangerous use of boiling water, electricity or ovens. MediBeads are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, easy to use and portable.

The <b>KNORK®</b> is a simple, multifunctional utensil. Its innovative shape has a balanced handle that provides stability and comfort. This design enables you to more easily cut food by using a rocking motion on the gently curved outside tines.

Knork is convenient in everyday dining situations, and graces the table with elegance and functionality.  Knorks will become your everyday every meal eating utensil.  It is also easier for a child to use than a regular fork and knife. Busy new mothers will find it helpful when trying to have a quick meal while nursing or when cutting up food for the young children. 

The <b>KNORK®</b> is available individually, in sets of four, or full place settings.  In addition to the featured Place KNORK described here, single 5-piece place settings include Salad KNORK, Place Knife, Place Spoon and Teaspoon, all with the KNORK’s distinctive styling, and all manufactured from the 18/10 forged stainless steel (18% chromium ensures durability, 10% nickel provides superior luster), hand formed from a single bar of the highest quality stainless steel available.  KNORK® Flatware comes in two beautiful finishes: Gloss and Matte.

The KNORK® can be used as an eating aid for people with limited hand mobility, from temporary injuries to permanent conditions such as severe arthritis and hemi-paralysis (more commonly known as one-sided paralysis.) 

KNORK® looks like a normal eating utensil and attracts no attention when using it. People who would otherwise require that their food be cut for them-- or else limit their meal choices-- can gain increased independence by using the KNORK®.  

Because of KNORK®’s rising popularity with stroke victims, amputees and others who only have the use of one hand, KNORK®s are slowly infiltrating hospital rehabilitation units and cafeterias across the country.

Unlike a knife, the knork cuts through food with a rocking motion which is facilitated by a finger platform on both sides of the handle. Knorks are symmetric and can be used by both left-handers and right-handers.

It is designed to help people who have medical conditions in which they either partially or completely lose the ability to independently move their leg.

The foot loop stays open until the strap is pulled and then conforms to the shape of the foot for a secure and comfortable grip. Rigid middle section allows for easy maneuverability. Once pulled, the loop closes and conforms to the shape of the foot for a secure and comfortable fit.  This, combined with the rigid middle section"" he asserts ""makes it easier to place on the foot than other leg lifts and reduces the risk of the foot falling out and becoming injured.

<b>Verilux</b> reading lamps use full spectrum light to enhance the clarity and contrast of reading materials. Our reading lamps are the result of more than 50 years of research and development focused on finding the optimal light for reading. Verilux Reading Lamps will improve your vision while reducing eyestrain and fatigue.

Light Therapy, also known as Phototherapy, is a growing field of research and product development which uses light to treat the symptoms of many diverse, but common, medical problems. Light therapy uses different colors of light to treat different ailments. For example, full spectrum light, or ""white"" sunlight is used to treat the depression and sleep disorders that result from Seasonal Affective Disorder (aka winter blues or SAD). Full Spectrum sunrise simulation is being used to treat sleep disorders - and to provide people a sound night's sleep - by regulating the bodies circadian rhythms. Narrow spectrum, blue light therapy, is being used to treat insomnia. Light therapy for skincare makes use of the soothing qualities of both blue and red light. Indeed, these are very exciting times for those interested in light therapy - the realization that people can treat their problems in an effective manner, free of drugs and with no side effects.",,"Light Therapy","Verilux reading lamps will improve your vision while reducing eyestrain and fatigue.","New",,"The Wright Stuff, Inc."

•	Pulling a person who is reclining in bed into a sitting position. 
•	Transferring a person from a bed to a chair. 
•	Leaning over a person for long periods of time.
<h2>General Tips to Avoid Injury:</h2>
•	Always keep the person who is being moved close to your body. 
•	Keep your feet shoulder-width apart to maintain your balance. 
•	Use the muscles in your legs to lift and/or pull. 
•	When you lift or move a person, maintain the proper alignment of your head and neck with your spine. Maintain the natural curve of your spine; don't bend at your waist. 
•	Avoid twisting your body when carrying a person. 
•	If the person is too heavy, get help.
<h2>Sitting up in bed</h2> 
<p>To move a person lying in bed to a wheelchair, put the chair close to the bed and lock the wheels. If the person is not strong enough to push up with his or her hands to a sitting position, place one of your arms under the person's legs and your other arm under his or her back. Move the person's legs over the edge of the bed while pivoting his or her body so the person ends up sitting on the edge of the bed. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, your knees bent and your back in a natural straight position.</p>

<h2>Standing up</h2> 
<p>If the person needs assistance getting into the chair, face the patient, place your feet shoulder-width apart and bend your knees. Position the person's feet on the floor and slightly apart. The person's hands should be on the bed or on your shoulders. Place your arms around the person's back and clasp your hands together. Nurses, physical therapists and others in hospitals often use lifting belts which are fastened around a person's waist. The caregiver grasps the belt when lifting the patient. Hold the person close to you, lean back and shift your weight.</p>
<h2>Sitting down</h2> 
<p>Pivot toward the chair, bend your knees and lower the person into the chair. The person should have both hands on the arms of the chair before lowering him or her down.</p>

Products and ideas to help make living with Arthritis a little easier.","Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Arthritis Daily Living Aids:General Articles and Information",No,,,"<h2>Products and ideas to help make living with Arthritis a little easier…</h2>
Living with arthritis can present a wide array of challenges.  Some of these challenges may be temporary, following surgery or during periods of flare-ups.  Some of these challenges may be life long.  Arthritis can create problems with mobility, range of motion, fine motor skills, and cause pain and fatigue that may affect the performance of daily tasks. While surgery, physical therapy and pain management may help some people with some of these issues, for the most part there is no way to remove the cause of the difficulty.  Therefore, it is important for the person with arthritis to find solutions to some of these basic problems, and fortunately there are many products available that can help. 

Assistive devices are nothing new.  They are used by the elderly, by people of all ages with arthritis, by joint-replacement patients during recovery.  According to The New York Arthritis Reporter, “These tools are not only helpful to get a certain job done, they are also essential to preserving the integrity of joints already compromised….Another advantage they offer is the ability to maintain the user’s independence in performing everyday activities, from personal hygiene to household chores and work-related duties.”  Some of these devices can be very beneficial to arthritic patients.
<h3>DRESSING AND GROOMING</h3>
Challenges: A person may have trouble putting on shoes or socks, or cutting toe nails because of short or bowed forearms, or because hip or leg arthritis make bending difficult.  A person with limited range of motion in shoulders may have difficulty brushing or blow drying hair.  Arthritis in fingers and hands can affect one’s ability to button or tie.

Solutions:  There are many assistive devices available to help with these difficulties.  There are several varieties of a <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/ASN215"" target=""_blank"">Sock Aids</a> available for those who either cannot reach their feet or who have weak grasps.

For those who have difficulty tying shoes, slip on shoes are wonderful, but if you want to wear shoes that tie, shoelaces, such as <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/ACI201"" target=""_blank"">Coilers</a>, are available with coils that never need tying, or there are deluxe <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/AMI20"" target=""_blank"">Elastic Shoelaces</a>, that allow shoes to be slipped on and off without tying and untying.

<h3>MOBILITY</h3>
Challenges:   Mobility issues can fall into two categories:  dealing with mobility problems following surgery, and dealing with problems caused by arthritis, chronic pain and/or fatigue, or limb length discrepancies, including inability to walk for long distances or stand for long periods.

Solutions: For postoperative patients, there are different solutions available depending upon the type of surgery and the patient’s ability (or inability) to walk.  For some, a <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">wheelchair</a> will be necessary, while others may use walkers or crutches while they are non-weight bearing or partial weight bearing.  It is a good idea to have a preoperative physical therapy session to get familiar with the type of <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461326"" target=""_blank"">Mobility Aids</a> you will be using following surgery. 

For those suffering with chronic and severe fatigue and/or pain, wheelchairs may be necessary where prolonged periods of walking or standing will be taking place.  For many, canes can provide sufficient support during mobility. There are many different types of canes which provide specific solutions.   <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/AHS001"" target=""_blank"">Walking Cane Seats</a> are available, designed for people who require either walking or resting assistance.  
<h3>COOKING, CLEANING, AND EVERYDAY CHORES</h3>
Challenges: The combination of pain and fatigue, inability to bend down or reach up, weakness or pain in hands or wrists, can make cooking and cleaning difficult.
 
Solutions: <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/NC65590S"" target=""_blank"">Good Grips</a> makes a wide selection of products that are easy on the hands, from an ergonomic, natural grip bread knife <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/AMCPKTBK"" target=""_blank"">Bread Knife</a> to <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/911539"" target=""_blank"">Bottle and Can Openers</a>, vegetable peelers, and <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/AMI307"" target=""_blank"">Scissors</a>.  <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/NC28502"" target=""_blank"">Cutting Boards</a>, vegetable peelers, <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/NC28221"" target=""_blank"">Pan Holders</a>, and a <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/product/NC35789"" target=""_blank"">Spreadboard</a>, bread holder are available to allow for one-handed use without danger of things sliding away from you while you’re cutting, stirring or making sandwiches.

<p>BY SUE CURFMAN, MA, CCC</p>
<p>Source of article:  Nursing Homes/Long Term Care Management</p>
<p>Adapted with permission from an original article published at www.speechpathology.com.</p>
<p>Research and statistics clearly indicate that dehydration and malnutrition are prevalent and serious concerns with skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents. Studies indicate that 54% of all newly admitted SNF residents are malnourished; the prevalence of malnourished elderly in SNFs has been reported to range from 20 to 87%. In addition, 60% of all residents experience an initial weight loss following admission.</p>
<p>Many of the residents in these statistics had a dementia diagnosis, which places them at higher risk for weight loss and dehydration. In addition, current statistics estimate that 60 to 80% of all residents in long-term care have a dementia diagnosis. Thus, adequate nutrition and hydration in a resident with dementia is a central concern for all members of the family and healthcare team.</p>
<p>The effect of dementia on nutrition and hydration changes throughout the course of the degenerative disease process. In the early stage, the individual with dementia may forget to eat, may become depressed and not want to eat, or may become distracted and leave the table without eating. In the middle stage, the individual with dementia may be unable to sit long enough to eat, yet at this stage may require an additional 600 calories per day because of wandering and motor restlessness. In the late stage, the individual with dementia does not have intact oral motor skills for chewing and swallowing, thus becoming subject to malnourishment and “wasting away.”</p>
<p>This is one reason a facility can benefit from the involvement of a speech-language pathologist (SLP). The role of the SLP will change over time because of the progressive nature of the dementia disease process and its effect on swallowing function and nutrition. The SLP’s goal is the same as Medicare’s number one goal in these residents: “facilitating and maintaining safety for the resident during swallowing and p.o. intake” (Medicare Transmittal No. 597, Medicare Hospital Manual). It is imperative that the SLP, as well as the director of nursing and other key members of the caregiving team, have a solid understanding of dysphagia and appropriate treatment and management techniques specific to the disorder. Administrators and other nursing home professionals will also benefit from a general understanding of the complexities of caring for these residents.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/product/CLV303"" target=""_blank"">Family Guide to Alzheimer's Disease Video Series</a> provides an indispensable resource offering encouragement and instruction to those affected by Alzheimer’s Disease.</p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>The goal of assessment for an individual with dysphagia and dementia is to identify the nature of the dysphagia, identify the contributing factors, differentiate the physiologic impairment and/or cognitive dysfunction aspects, identify capacity for improved safety, and identify the potential benefit from skilled intervention. Specific components of the initial assessment include chart review, resident/caregiver/nursing interview, sensory function, head and neck positioning, oral motor skills, pattern of mastication, salivation, and laryngeal elevation. Each of the swallow assessment components are individually reviewed below.</p>
<p>Chart review</p>
<p>The course of recovery or progressive decline found in the diseases and surgical procedures linked to dysphagia vary widely. Once the disease process contributing to the dysphagia is identified, the clinician should determine the resident’s course of anticipated recovery or decline. Fortunately, the effect of progressive dementia on swallow function can be fairly predictable. Chart review takes on an even more primary role when the resident’s recall or ability to provide information is limited because of memory impairment, dementia, or other language deficits. Therefore, the following information in the medical record should be sought:</p>
(1) diagnoses; 
(2) current weight;
(3) recent weight changes;
(4) current and historic therapeutic/altered diets;
(5) current eating habits, including food types and amounts consumed at scheduled and unscheduled times;
(6) self-feeding skills throughout the course of the meal;
(7) eating and chewing difficulties;
(8) signs/symptoms (from nursing notes) of congestion, coughing, choking with drinking or taking medications, fever, and lethargy;
(9) x-ray results (e.g., chest and modified barium swallow); and  
(10) history of pneumonia

<p>Resident/caregiver/nursing interview.</p> 
<p>Two key questions for the resident are: (1) “What are your problems with eating, drinking, and swallowing?” and (2) “Why do you think you are having a problem with swallowing?” Besides valuable information about the resident’s perception of the illness, you can get a sense of the resident’s overall cognitive status and ability to attend to and follow directions and learn new information. This will influence the nature of the treatment program.</p>
<p>Many residents with dysphagia as a result of neurologic impairment will be unable to participate in the interview process because of expressive and/or receptive communication problems or cognitive dysfunction. If so, the necessary information can be obtained from a caregiver or family member who is familiar with the resident.</p>
<p>Sensory function.</p> 
<p>It is important to determine whether the resident’s sensory pathways are intact, intermittently intact, or absent. The following six anatomic sites are assessed to determine this, in this order:</p>
- tongue (anterior two-thirds);
- tongue (posterior one-third); 
- hard palate;
- soft palate;
- posterior pharyngeal wall; and 
-laryngeal region.

<p>Sample sensory deficits that may be discovered include decreased p.o. intake secondary to altered/absent perception of taste; diminished safety mechanism for sensing hot food, with potential/actual intraoral injuries; and/or profound sensory deficits in the later stages of the disease that eliminate any functional mastication pattern.</p>
<p>Head and neck positioning.</p> 
<p>Assessment considers both habitual body position and habitual head position. Note whether the resident is able to complete independent positioning on instruction or is at least able to assist in positioning. Three common head/neck positions occur in the later stages of dementia: chronic head/neck flexion, variable head/neck flexion/extension caused by a lack of positioning management, and chronic head/neck hyper-extension. The only appropriate goal of intervention at this late stage is to improve the resident’s functional behaviors through the use of adaptive equipment or assistive devices; no rehab potential remains because of the bilateral brain destruction.</p>

<p>Oral motor skills.</p> 
<p>The clinician will: (1) visually inspect and assess ROM, strength, and coordination of individual oral structures, including lips, tongue (anterior, middle, and posterior), and soft palate; and (2) assess the functional movement patterns required for the oral stage of swallowing, including food bolus manipulation during chewing, cohesive food bolus formation, anterior-to-posterior transit of cohesive food bolus, and transfer or dropping of food bolus into pharynx.</p>
<p>Pattern of mastication.</p> 
<p>The clinician will assess both the muscles associated with mastication and the pattern of mastication. The oral motor function will determine the pattern of mastication, which deteriorates in a predictable fashion with the progression of dementia. The progressive deterioration in the mastication patterns below reflects a transition from higher level reflex integration to lower level reflex integration during the course of dementia:</p>
(1) rotary chew pattern;
(2) lateral chew/chomping pattern and jaw-jerk reflex; 
(3) suck-swallow pattern and
(4) absent oral motor function for chewing.

<p>Salivation.</p> 
<p>Assessment of salivary function includes three components: (1) visual inspection of the oral mucosa to determine adequacy of salivary flow, (2) medication review, and (3) medical history review. Common drug classes that reduce salivation include anticholinergic, antidepressant, and anti-psychotic drugs. If salivary flow is adequate, the oral cavity will appear wet; if hypo-salivation is present, the oral cavity will become dry. Symptoms of dry mouth (xerostomia) include mouth pain; difficulty chewing; difficulty swallowing; weight loss; mouth infections; tooth decay; a dry, cracked tongue; bleeding gums; cracked corners of the mouth; badly fitting dentures; and dryness in the eyes, nose, skin, and throat. If complaints or visual inspection indicate a dry mouth, the resident should be assessed for other signs/symptoms of dehydration, including dry mucous membranes; loss of skin turgor; intense thirst; flushed skin; oliguria (decreased urine output in relation to fluid intake); dark, yellow urine; and/or possible elevated temperature.</p>
<p>Analyzing volitional swallows and laryngeal elevation.</p> 
<p>Once initiated, the swallow should occur briskly. The clinician will also assess laryngeal elevation during dry and/or bolus swallows. The components of laryngeal elevation would include the speed of laryngeal elevation, the movement of the structures involved, and the integrity of their movement.</p>
<h3>Assessment Analysis.</h3>
<p>The information from the chart review, interview, clinical swallow assessment, and instrumental assessment is reviewed and analyzed to determine the presence of dysphagia, as well as level, severity, and primary etiology of contributing factors. The question then is whether the resident demonstrates dysphagia secondary to a physiologic deficit and/or a cognitive deficit. Many swallowing and eating impairments are secondary to the primary dementia diagnosis, which is the focus of the remainder of this article.</p>
<p>Dysphagia of Dementia.</p>
<p>The resident may demonstrate the following secondary conditions related to the primary dementia diagnosis:</p> 

<p>- absent oral motor pattern for mastication; 
- poor sensory awareness/integration;
- negative reaction to food textures and consistencies; 
- suck-swallow mastication pattern;
- significant irreversible pharyngeal dysphagia; and  
- reduced p.o. intake secondary to behavioral issues possibly related to dementia</p>
<p>Treatment Recommendations.</p>
<p>Dysphagia treatment can be divided into direct treatment and indirect treatment. In direct treatment, the clinician works directly with the resident, teaching him or her compensatory strategies. Examples of direct dysphagia treatment interventions include sensory stimulation, diet modification, muscle strengthening, ROM exercises, and caregiver training in feeding assistance.</p>
<p>With indirect treatment, the clinician sets up an individualized plan of care incorporating environmental modifications, adaptive equipment/assistive devices, safety strategies, etc., that are used by a designated caregiver. Examples of indirect dysphagia treatment interventions include addition of sweetener to food items (if only sweet taste receptors remain); use of alternative nutritional systems, such as enteral feeding; and/or oral care/sensory stimulation provided by nursing.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/product/CAM107A"" target=""_blank"">Dysphagia Cup</a> is a special design cup for people who have difficulty swallowing.</p>
<p>Treatment recommendations may include:</p> 
<p>sensory stimulation and/or integration, such as increasing texture variation (dry crackers or crisp cookies), increasing mouth sensation, and facilitating mastication pattern; diet management (as prescribed), development of an individualized plan of care/functional maintenance program (FMP), and caregiver training for implementation. An FMP is a detailed program of strategies and instruction carried out by the caregiver that maximizes resident skills to maintain the highest level of functional independence; providing oral care from nursing before meals with a citric swab to increase salivation; offering the resident six small meals daily; offering the resident calorie-loaded finger foods throughout the day to increase p.o. intake of calories; involving the resident in a facility hydration program; and evaluating the resident by PT/OT for appropriate positioning to expedite safe, effective swallow function and meal completion.</p>
<p>Enteral Feeding and End-of-Life Decisions</p>
<p>More than one-third of severely cognitively impaired elderly residents in U.S. nursing homes have feeding tubes. However, studies by Murphy and Lipman, as well as Finucane et al, conclude that there are no documented changes in nutritional status, pressure sores, or other functional status following gastrostomy tube placement in these residents.1,2 Tube feeding is not proven to prevent “wasting away,” and there is no survival benefit in residents with dementia who receive enteral feeding. Issues related to enteral feeding to sustain life in the end stage of dementia should be discussed with the resident and family early in the disease process. It is optimal for the person to state his/her own preference regarding enteral feeding before losing the ability to communicate such complex ideas. If the resident cannot do this, it is important to provide caregivers with adequate information regarding available treatment options and the consequences related to nutritional intake.</p>  
<h3>Table Strategies for managing residents with dementia and dysphagia</h3>  
<p>CHALLENGE INTERVENTION</p>  
<p>FORGETFULNESS AND DISORIENTATION</p> 
<p>Misinterprets or ignores the body signals of hunger and the need for food Offer liquids and water consistently throughout the day, as residents usually do not ask for a drink. Dehydration may trigger increased combativeness and urinary tract infections. Place beverage bars featuring different juice flavors in high-traffic areas.</p>  
<p>Plays with food/forgets how to eat/does not recognize food as food Residents frequently do not transition from the before-meal activity to the meal itself, thus they play with food because no environmental cues trigger identification of the change. Offer environmental interventions to signal the change to eating, including items altering the appearance of the table, such as a tablecloth, flowers, baskets for napkins, and place mats.</p>  
<p>Eats with fingers instead of utensils Increase the number of finger foods being offered. Serve hot cereal or soups in a mug, or cut fresh fruits and vegetables into bite-size pieces. Serve gravies and sauces in a side dish for dipping. Offer items such as breakfast bars, finger gelatin, and “edible containers"" such as ice cream cones as options. Continue to try to encourage eating with utensils if the resident’s skill level can be advanced.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/product/CDM6029"" target=""_blank"">Clothing Protector</a> is easy to put on and take off with hook and loop closure.  Measures 18 x 24 inches for chest to lap protection.</p>  
<p>Does not use utensils correctly Limit the number of utensils. Often elderly residents with dementia eat with a knife because they pick it up with their dominant hand to cut their food (whether needed or not) and then forget to put it down to select a fork or spoon.</p>  
<p>Is unable to make choices if too much food or too many containers are present at one time Serve one course at a time so that the necessity of making choices is limited and there are fewer distractions; when appropriate, allow menu selection and the choice between two or three main courses. If dining at a restaurant, offer the menu and give the cueing needed to help with choices. For example, “Would you prefer chicken or beef today?” If residents cannot make choices at all and you know their likes/dislikes, you might say, “This restaurant is noted for its excellent roast beef. Would you like some?”</p>
<p>If residents feel that there is too much food on their plate, use two plates, serving half a meal at a time.</p>  
<p>Demonstrates an inability to understand what is expected of him/her at mealtime Establish the same routine at each meal. Reinforce with simple one-step directions using visual and gestural cueing. Placement of the fork/spoon in the resident’s preferred hand and hand-over-hand caregiver assistance may trigger the eating process.</p>  
<p>LIMITED ATTENTION SPAN</p> 
<p>Has an inability to attend to the task of eating, limiting the meal from being consumed entirely Use simple words. Touch and redirect the resident to the task of eating. Five or six meals per day may be needed for residents who are unable to eat much at any one time if they become agitated when caregivers attempt to refocus them.</p>  
<p>Leaves the table during the meal The meal may be a combination of sitting and eating, followed by walking and eating finger foods from a bowl. Make sandwiches with anything that will hold together. Waist pouches may help a pacer to keep his/her hands free so he/she can hold finger foods.<p>  
<p>JUDGMENT AND SAFETY</p> 
<p>Eats food pieces that are too big to swallow safely Assess food pieces for size, thickness, and consistency and make necessary adjustments. Consider providing precut meats and other food items cut into bite-size pieces.</p>  
<p>Eats non-edibles Avoid garnishes that are not easily chewed or eaten or that are decorative in nature.</p>  
<p>Pours liquids onto foods If residents pour liquids over food, it may be necessary to provide them only when food is not present.</p>  
<p>Takes another resident’s food Offer visual cueing for boundaries by using place mats to reduce interest in another’s meal. Square tables provide better definition of territory than round tables.</p>  
<p>PERCEPTUAL DYSFUNCTION</p> 
<p>Has difficulty discriminating boundaries between items Focus on color contrast in terms of the food to the plate or cup, and the contrast of the plate to the place mat. Supporting visual interpretation can reduce the resident’s anxiety.</p>  
<p>Communication: Understanding and being understood Develop a list of food preferences and dislikes.</p>
<p>Use multi-sensory cueing with frequent pointing. Lift the item away from the table or lift the food from the plate to regain attention.</p>
<p>Use verbal encouragement, such as, “This is a new recipe I want to cook for my daughter. Would you please try it and tell me what you think?”</p>
<p>When asking questions about food choices, use “either/or” questions rather than “yes/no” questions, which could lead to “nos” and not eating.</p>  
<p>Weight gain/loss Doubling up on breakfast may help to maintain weight.</p>
<p>Offer snacks between meals and before bedtime.</p>
<p>Alternate hot and cold foods to help trigger a swallow.</p>
<p>Establish a policy so that honey and sugar may be used on food, if medically appropriate, as these entice residents to eat.</p>
<p>Sweet taste receptors remain intact through the end stage; therefore, residents with end-stage disease usually favor sweets and can be enticed to eat by adding sweet thickeners to their foods.</p>
<p>Offer high-protein and increased calorie foods.</p>  
<p>ANXIETY</p> 
<p>Says someone is seated “in my place” Some residents prefer or demand the same seat every time and will become aggressive if someone else sits “in my seat.” Consider using name cards, or remove the resident’s seat until just before he/she arrives at the table.</p>  
<p>Sits too close to others or someone he/she dislikes Be aware of residents’ preferred table-mates. Staff should be alert to making a last-minute seating change. An acceptable peer group is important.</p>  
<p>CONCERNS AND PRIDE</p> 
<p>Has no money to pay for a meal Issue meal tickets or “credit cards,” or have a bill filled out with a receipt that helps residents with “no money” to accept the meal.</p>
<p>Offer color play money for residents to use, or tell them the meal is paid for by insurance.</p>
<p>Inform them that the meal is part of the “club” membership; therefore, it is required that they eat dinner at the club.</p>  
<p>Dining area, equipment</p> 
<p>May behave disruptively because of room size and setup, type and size of tables, lighting, window glare, dishes, glassware, or utensils Have a variety of tables available to meet specific, individualized needs. A table for one or two may be needed if a resident with dementia is experiencing hostility or paranoia.</p>
<p>Square tables create a sense of “my space”; round tables create the illusion of someone eating off another’s plate.</p>
<p>Glare from windows or lights can create agitation; if feasible, encourage natural sunlight.</p>
<p>Provide cups and glassware that are easy to grasp. Consider serving soups and hot cereals in a mug or soup bowl with handles.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>From the earlier stages of forgetfulness and confusion to the end stage of impending death, provisions must be made by caregivers and professionals to encourage and maintain adequate nutrition for residents with dementia. Strategies for managing some of these changes are summarized in the table.</p>

<p>The effect of progressive dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, on swallowing function and independent eating/feeding will change over the course of the disease. The SLP, in collaboration with the physician, can play a vital role as a member of the multidisciplinary healthcare team in assessing the nature of the dysphagia and the contributing factors, developing an individualized plan of care to effectively manage the behaviors and strategies to ensure optimal nutrition and hydration, providing caregiver education in safe swallow strategies, and providing informed education regarding alternative nutritional systems. Basic assessment and management skills are also important for the day-to-day nursing staff.</p>

Here are some ways you can make gardening a fun, accessible activity.","Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Daily Living Aids To Make Life Easier:Garden Tools",No,,,"<p>People with disabilities often find themselves adapting an activity, transforming it from something that isn&#8217;t doable into something that lets them be more involved and independent. People who love the outdoors, rejoice! Gardening can be a great way for people with disabilities to be active. It just takes a little creative thinking and adaptation. Here are some ways you can make gardening a fun, accessible activity.</p>
<h3>Think creatively</h3>
<p>People with disabilities are particularly good at thinking creatively. Apply a little outside-the-box thinking to your garden and you can make it a much friendlier environment than the traditional garden. If you&#8217;re using a wheelchair, try arranging your garden in such a way that you can get within reach of your plants. If you&#8217;re using a wheelchair, make sure that you have any <a href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/wheelchair-accessories.html"">wheelchair accessories</a> you might need to make you more comfortable. For example, if you are going to be out in the summer heat, consider getting an <a href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/folding-wheelchair-cup-holder.html"">attachable cup holder</a> and keeping a cold drink with you so that you don&#8217;t get dehydrated.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/planting-stick.html"" rel=""shadowbox[sbpost-1436];player=img;""><img class="" wp-image-1437 alignnone"" title=""The Planting Stick"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/36a602051bbe1f49894fee20fc55235b-59x300.jpg"" alt=""The Planting Stick"" width=""47"" height=""239"" /></a></p>
<p>If you can stand but have trouble kneeling or bending over, you can use tools like <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/planting-stick.html"">The Planting Stick</a> that are made to be used standing up. The Planting Stick lets you dig the perfect hole by simply pressing down on the neoprene ball and using the cushioned turning crank to rotate the tool clockwise. It&#8217;s made of welded-steel for optimal durability and can last for many growing seasons.</p>
<h3>Get comfy with ergonomic tools</h3>
<div id=""attachment_1441"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/eagrgatoseto.html""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1441"" title=""Easi Grip collection of ergonomic tools"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/21f02d211cb5ac4f0c30b0076a9c90fb.jpeg"" alt=""Easi Grip collection of ergonomic tools"" width=""300"" height=""224"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Easi Grip collection of ergonomic tools</p></div>
<p>Many garden tools require you to work around them instead of working the way you need them to. Get more control and leverage by using the ergonomically designed <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/eagrgatoseto.html"">tools by Easi Grip</a>. These tools have non-slip handles set at right angles so that the position of your hand as you grip the tools are more natural. This keeps you from having to bend and twist your wrists.</p>
<h3>Get support</h3>
<p>Many people with disabilities have trouble using their hands and instead rely on the strength of their upper arms. In that case, using hand tools can be difficult. The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/eagrarmsucu.html"">Easi Grip Arm Support Cuff</a> can be plugged into the the back of any Easi Grip hand tools to allow you to make use of your arm and shoulder while handling the tools.</p>
<div id=""attachment_1428"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/eagrarmsucu.html""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-1428"" title=""Easi Grip Arm Support Cuff"" src=""http://www.thewright-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/edebf28eadf9bab31f6b8b236f07f2bf-300x300.jpg"" alt=""Easi Grip Arm Support Cuff"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Easi Grip Arm Support Cuff</p></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re not a wheelchair user but you find it difficult to walk, stand, or kneel for long periods of time, you can sit down and stay mobile with the <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/gardnseatcaddy.html"">Garden Seat Caddy</a>. It gives you a seat on wheels and includes a tray under the seat so that you can keep your tools handy.</p>
<h3>Extend your range with long-reach tools</h3>
<p>Some places in the garden are just pesky to get to. And when you have a mobility impairment, even more so. You can use long-reach tools to help you get to those hard to reach places, or to help you reach the ground while in a seated position. <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/eagrloregato4.html"">Easi Grip Long Reach Tools</a> have the right angle grip and can be combined with the arm support cuffs to allow for optimal reach and comfort.</p>
<h3>Know thyself</h3>
<p>Truer advice cannot be given! No one knows your individual needs quite like <em>you</em> do. Be careful not to push yourself beyond what you can take. Pace yourself, take breaks if you need to, and keep yourself as comfortable as possible by using adaptive tools and equipment. By keeping yourself comfortable, you can spend more time doing what you love.</p>

<br><br>
The MedCenter System medication organizer consists of 31 dated daily pill boxes with 4 compartments in each for morning, noon, evening, and night scheduled doses. Each pill box is labeled with the date and time of day. To provide an answer to the question of how many pills will each pill box hold, we counted the number of m&m® candies that would fit in each compartment.  Each dose compartment holds 10 m&m® candies, and each pill box holds 40 m&m® candies.
<br><br>
You can set up to 4 daily alarms to alert you when your medication is due. A repeating friendly reminder notifies you of the time, the date and which daily dose to take: ""Good morning! Please take your morning pills for the 20th."" Press the red acknowledged button to confirm compliance and the talking alarm clock tells you when the next daily dose is due. The alarm features loud or extra loud settings to ensure that the alarm is heard. Red and Green indicators provide added peace of mind that pills were taken.

MediBeads Microwave Activated Moist Heat Wraps are the first new heat therapy products to deliver immediate pain relieving moist heat therapy and meet the criteria of an Ideal Analgesic Modality.
<br><br>
MediBeads are washable, odor-free, dust free, and will not support bacteria or fungal growth. Unlike other grain and pellet products, MediBeads need no special covers, they will not dry out, dissolve or disintegrate. 
<br><br>
When microwaved, MediBeads draw moisture from the air and release it as clean, deeply-penetrating moist heat - no need to add water.
<br><br>
Because MediBeads Wraps are ready for use in just a minute and are applied directly to the site of pain, relief begins immediately. The wraps continue to deliver therapeutic moist heat for up to thirty minutes. This is the medically recommended treatment time for heat therapy within a three to four hour period. MediBeads recharge quickly and can be used again as necessary. 
<br><br>
Through a patient pending process, the OrthoBeads in MediBeads continuously recharge by absorbing only water molecules from the air. Adding water is not necessary. The absorbed water is held, purified and released as ""clean moist heat"" when the MediBeads Wrap is microwaved. The result is a bacteria and odor-free wrap. MediBeads Wraps are washable, so no special covers are required. 
<br><br>
When removed from the microwave, the temperature of MediBeads Wrap does not increase. This prevents inadvertent burns, which are caused by the continued temperature increase (""cooking"") prevalent in all gel packs. Microwave activation eliminates potentially dangerous use of boiling water, electricity or ovens. MediBeads are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, easy to use and portable.
<br><br>
Unique wrap designs offer excellent conformance to body contours while allowing full mobility during treatment. This portability enhances range of motion exercises and permits therapy to continue while ""on the go"". Natural hydration eliminates messy sponges, cloths or towels. 
<br><br>
MediBeads Wraps are an excellent value. They are well-constructed of specially chosen materials and, with proper use, will give many years of service.",,"MediBeads Moist Heat Wraps","Microwave activated moist heat wraps provide therapeutic moist heat for immediate pain relieving moist heat therapy.","New",,"The Wright Stuff, Inc."

Second, the light uses a lighting sensor to determine if it is in a low level light environment. Only when it is in a low light environment and in use will the light illuminate.

</P>
<P>Mobility is a relative condition. If you are usually confined to a bed, you 
are well aware that it's almost a vacation to be able to get up and move around 
the house or apartment by yourself. Make some breakfast or coffee without the 
assistance of your spouse or caregiver? Yes, you would love to do it. If you're 
not bed-ridden but do find yourself spending most of your days indoors, mobility 
means going out of the house on one's own or with assistance, to the library, a 
senior center, grocery store, theater, or over to see the grandkids.</P>
<P>In days past, people who had arthritis, injuries, or any condition that 
limited their mobility just had to deal with it. No longer. With great new <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/919083"" target=""_blank"">smart 
mobility aids</A>, you can get around, up, down, in, and out--as well as anyone 
else!</P>
<H3>Getting Out of the Bed</H3>
<P>First things first. Let's get out of bed. For those confined to the bed, 
moving off the bed often feels like the biggest task of the day. Even if you're 
not usually bed-ridden, you'll know that lying horizontally for a long period 
makes it that much harder to get up. </P>
<P>There are several different classes of <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/919083"" target=""_blank"">mobility 
aids to assist you in getting off the bed</A>:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Extra-wide and extra-sturdy handles or canes to grip while moving off. 
  <LI>Flat transfer boards to help you slide easy off of uneven surfaces. 
  <LI>Transfer discs--like lazy susans for people--to help you pivot in place 
  with minimal hip and leg discomfort. 
  <LI>Transfer slings and gait belts, to help your spouse or caregiver shift 
  you.. </LI></UL>
<H3>Moving Off the Sofa or Chair</H3>
<P>The sofa or chair can be a welcome respite from pain and discomfort 
associated with walking and moving. However, should you attempt to move off the 
sofa or chair, it suddenly feels like you're being gripped by a giant hand. 
Furniture always seems too low, too unstable. Furniture doesn't have anything to 
grab onto. How about some <A

  <LI>Risers to give a little extra boost to your chair. 
  <LI>Big couch canes to give you the sturdy grip that couches don't have. 
  <LI>Flat, solid transfer boards to slide from place to place. </LI></UL>
<H3>Sliding Out of the Car</H3>
<P>If a sofa is difficult to rise from, just try a car seat. Ever noticed quite 
how low car seats are? And just at the point when you need something to grip, 
there isn't anything. Manufacturers of mobility aids know your plight, and have 
designed <A

  much more comfortable. 
  <LI>Looking for that bar to grip onto? Transfer bars with soft handles help 
  you <I>help yourself</I> out of the car. </LI></UL>

Because <b>MediBeads Wraps</b> are ready for use in just a minute and are applied directly to the site of pain, relief begins immediately. The wraps continue to deliver therapeutic moist heat for up to thirty minutes. This is the medically recommended treatment time for heat therapy within a three to four hour period.

Through a patent pending process, MediBeads continuously recharge by absorbing only water molecules from the air. Adding water is not necessary. The absorbed water is held, purified and released as ""clean moist heat"" when the MediBeads Wrap is microwaved. The result is a bacteria and odor-free wrap. Unlike other grain and pellet products, MediBeads need no special covers, they will not dry out, dissolve or disintegrate. <b>MediBeads Wraps</b> are washable, so no special covers are required.

When removed from the microwave, the temperature of MediBeads Wrap does not increase. This prevents inadvertent burns, which are caused by the continued temperature increase (""cooking"") prevalent in all gel packs. Microwave activation eliminates potentially dangerous use of boiling water, electricity or ovens. MediBeads are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, easy to use and portable.

What makes her different — she is an arthritic person.","Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Arthritis Daily Living Aids:Getting Ready",No,,,"<h2>How Janice Went from Pain to Ease with Arthritic Aids</h2>
<p>At one time, she could sleep until the sun rose high 
in the sky, but that was before. Now, it's early to bed and early to rise--and pain is her alarm clock. She could be anybody; we will call her Janice. What makes her different—she is an arthritic person.</p>
<h3>Toilet Time Made Easier with Sanitary Arthritic Aids</h3>
<p>At one time, Janice dreaded the morning toilet ritual. It meant asking her husband, Stan, to help her onto the toilet. As time progressed and the pain become worse, Stan even had to help her with cleaning herself. Even though they had been married over 45 years, Janice understandably found this to be very embarrassing.</p>
<p>But <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/913209"" target=""_blank"">arthritic toiletry aids</a> changed all of that. Easing herself onto the toilet became a simple matter with elevated toilet seats or seats with strong arms to hold onto. The best gadgets, though, and the ones that made Janice feel more self-reliant: the wiping aids. Long ago it had become difficult to reach back or front to clean herself, and so hygiene was always a concern.  Special tongs, spring-loaded clips, or even silicone-coated <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/913209"" target=""_blank"">wiping aids</a> helped change all of that, and gave Janice her personal toilet space back. </p>
<h3>From Toilet to the Bath: No Fear of Slipping</h3>
<p>Janice goes straight from the toilet area to the shower. At one time, bathing was uncomfortable, painful, and slow. Often, her husband would assist. Showers are difficult to stand in for any length of time, and she didn't always want to take baths. Some parts of the body were difficult to reach and often didn't get washed as closely as they should have. </p>
<p>Now, taking a bath or shower is a snap with the help of a wide variety of
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53724"" target=""_blank"">arthritic bathing aids</a>. Janice was surprised at first to see how many <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53725"" target=""_blank"">bath and shower chairs</a> were available for arthritic persons: seats, grab bars, non-slip treads, sliding benches, and swiveling chairs.</p>
<p>Once in the shower, she takes advantage of more great shower aids like no-rinse shampoo, a long-handled scrubber, and even a tingly foot scrubber to clean and relax her soles.</p>
<h3>Dressing from Head to Toe Without Assistance</h3>
<p>Finally, it's time to dress. What was once a series of painful maneuvers--often requiring help from her husband--is now pleasant with the help of <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461290"" target=""_blank"" target=""_blank"">arthritic dressing aids</a>. Janice puts on her own socks with clever sock aids; inserts her feet snugly into shoes with telescopic shoe horns; and laces up with special fasteners. Dressing sticks gently grasp her clothing and assist her in dressing.  Because of its soft tips, the dressing stick has always handled her dresses and blouses with the care they deserve.</p>
<p>Bathed and dressed, Janice is bright and ready for the day.  Best of all, she did it all by herself, and with no pain or discomfort.</p>

Longer length will accommodate patients and transfers in areas where space is not an issue. This model has been used successfully in boosting or repositioning patients in bed.

<h4>The ""No-Lift"" Frictionless BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer System</h4>
BeasyTrans™ Systems are totally portable. With the BeasyTrans™ Systems, most users can achieve regular access to an automobile. For some, this may mean a greater quality of life. The visiting of friends and relatives may be resumed. Educational and cultural undertakings can be attended. The systems may even allow the user to live at home while receiving outpatient care, rather than living in a long term facility and even for travelling!

<h4>Tissue Friendly - Elimination of Skin Friction</h4>
It's a well documented fact: lifting leads to injury. For example, patient movement tasks statistically place nursing personnel in the top percentile of the U.S. labor force for back injuries. At the same time, the person being lifted is at risk for arm and brachial plexus type injuries as well as back injuries from being torqued or twisted. The risk of such injuries is tremendously reduced when lifting is eliminated. The frictionless, lateral slide is clearly the state of the art in patient transfer. 

<h4>Versatility</h4>
The design of the BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer Systems make it possible to apply sliding technology to a wide range of transfer and therapeutic functions in both the clinical and homecare environment. 

For example, strategic placement of the Beasy seat under a draw sheet allows a minimum number of caregivers to easily perform such difficult transfers as bed to gurney, supine, or boosting of patients.

Because the seat easily rotates 360 degrees, the systems can be used for range of motion exercises for hands, feet or other body parts.

<P>It's funny how the common perception of walkers is that they are slow, 
creaky, and outmoded. This little steel-and-rubber beauty is actually one of the 
best things to come down the pike in recent years for persons who need a little 
help getting around. </P>
<P>What are your other options? Wheelchairs are great, but unless you really 
need one, they are hard to maneuver and unwieldy to stow in cars. Canes--you 
can't get much lighter and simpler than a cane--but some people need more than 
one extra leg to help them along. That's why the walker is such a great mobility 
aid. It's like a cane, but with four legs. It's like a wheelchair, but it's far 
lighter and it lets you stand up. </P>
<P>So if you've got a stock, straight-off-the-dealer's-lot walker, you may want 
to provision it with some accessories for you to hit the road in style and 
safety. After all, no self-respecting auto connoisseur would be caught dead 
driving his Jaguar without extra doo-dads to turn heads as he speeds along the 
highway. Here's your shopping list:</P>
<H3>Your Headlights</H3>
<P>Can you believe it, but walkers now have <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344384"" target=""_blank"">headlights</A>? 
Super-bright LED lights easily strap on with Velcro and illuminate the road up 
to eight feet in front and four feet to the side. Bulbs last up to 50,000 hours 
and the lights take just one 9 volt battery.</P>
<H3>Your Steering Wheel Cover</H3>
<P>Otherwise known as <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344384"" target=""_blank"">walker 
grips</A>. Get a firm, comfortable grasp on your walker with terrycloth or 
fleece hand grips that go on easily, and keep your hands nice and dry. Regular 
walker grips are no good for anything other than getting from the bedroom to the 
bathroom. If you want to go out, or just be comfortable with your indoor 
travels, walker grips are the way to go.</P>
<H3>Your Accessory Holders</H3>
<P>Forget about putting your groceries, books, or personal items in a plastic 
bag and hanging it from your walker. With this wide range of <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344384"" target=""_blank"">accessory 
holders designed specifically for walkers</A>, it's a snap to put them on--and 
they carry so much. </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Solid Baskets - sturdy poly baskets that attach to the front and hold 
  heavy items. 
  <LI>Small Holders - clamp-ons for small items like a phone or glasses. 
  <LI>Front Bags - truly the workhorse of accessory bags. 
  <LI>Side Bags - a good way to keep accessories away from your legs as you 
  walk. 
  <LI>Carry Alls - the most spacious bag for the largest items you will want to 
  carry. 
  <LI>Bag Hooks - carry a purse or a couple of light-weight grocery bags. 
</LI></UL>
<H3>Your Wheels</H3>
<P>Have you ever noticed how difficult it is to move your walker on carpeted 
surfaces? Not quite wheels, but these <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344384"" target=""_blank"">skis, 
tips, balls, and slides for walkers</A> help you move smoothly on surfaces that 
are less than smooth. You will be amazed at how much more pleasant walking can 
be with one of these devices to save arms from continually picking up and moving 
the walker.</P>
<H3>Your Drink Holders</H3>
<P>Last but not least, but sure to pick up a <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344384"" target=""_blank"">walker 
cup holder</A> to pick up your Starbucks coffee at the drive-thru before hitting 
the road again. </P>

Using the G-Tube Belt should be done after consultation with a physician. It is recommended that a sterile drain sponge with slit for tube entry be placed against the skin as a buffer. Wrap waist strap around waist and secure to a comfortable fit using the hook and loop closure for adjustment. Slide tube through slit to pouch and position pouch over tube accordingly. Secure tube while not in use by coiling onto pouch face and then close bottom flap securely over tube coil.<br><br>
Care Instructions: G-Tube Belt flannel center pouch and soft elastic fabric waistband are conveniently machine washable. Hand or machine wash with a mild disinfectant and hang dry. Be sure to engage the hook and loop fasteners before washing to prevent lint accumulation.

everyday task. Nowadays, even though you think long and hard about getting 
from Point A to Point B, you don't always have a ready solution.</p>
<p>That's where personal mobility aids come in. Designers and 
manufacturers <i>have</i> put in the time and money and <i>do have</i> wonderful 
solutions to your mobility challenges.</p>
<p>Are any of these scenarios familiar to you?</p>
<h3>The Challenge: Getting In and Out of Cars</h3>
<p>Velour, leather, and cloth car seats present a distinct problem to folks who 
experience pain and discomfort associated with mobility. It's nearly 
impossible to slide out of these seats, much less rotate one's legs out of the 
car.</p>
<p>The Solution: <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/cartrai.html"">Car 
seat slides</a> and <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/cartrai.html"">swivels</a> 
that make getting in and out of cars a snap. Add a
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/cartrai.html"">transfer bar</a>, and you've 
got a sturdy, stable surface to grip onto. </p>
<h3>The Challenge: Being Physically Shifted by a Caregiver</h3>
<p>If you have very limited mobility, you may need to be physically shifted from 
bed to wheelchair, wheelchair to car, or other variations. If 
you are a caregiver, you may know the difficulty of transferring a person who 
has limited mobility. It is difficult to grasp patients without causing 
bruising and pain.</p>
<p>The Solution: <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/gaandtrbe.html"">Gait 
and transfer belts</a> are strong, specially padded belts that have grip handles 
for assisting people who need help moving from one place to another.</p>
<h3>The Challenge: Wheelchairs and Hot Coffee Don't Mix</h3>
<p>As if it's not hard enough to propel a wheelchair, just try doing it with a 
cup of hot coffee wedged between your legs.</p>
<p>The Solution: Spiffy
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/cupandmugho.html"">cup holders</a> uniquely 
designed to attach to wheelchairs, freeing up your arms and hands to move the 
chair.</p>
<h3>The Challenge: Walkers that Catch on Carpeting</h3>
<p>Those grippy rubber tips on walkers are great for slick floors, but terrible 
for carpeting. They tend to catch on the carpeting. Next thing you 
know, you're doing a forward somersault!</p>
<p>The Solution: <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">Walker 
glides and slides</a> that pop right on the bottoms of the legs and let you 
""ski"" over any carpeted surface.</p>
<h3>The Challenge: Walker + Stack of Books or Rental Movies = Disaster</h3>
<p>Yes, walkers were meant to be operated with two hands. How then do you 
operate the walker and hold those books, movies, or groceries at the same time?</p>
<p>The Solution: You have your choice of an array of
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waac.html"">walker baskets and bags</a>--any 
size, any shape, and for almost any function. </p>
<h3>The Challenge: Crutch Discomfort</h3>
<p>Weren't crutches meant to help you, not hurt you? But it's looking that 
way, what with those blisters and bruises on your palms, forearms, and 
underarms.</p>
<p>The Solution: <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/crac.html"">
Wonderfully soft gel pads</a> easily attach to crutches to reduce shock, 
vibration, and rubbing of hands, forearms, and underarms.</p>

Baryshnikov every time you want to move from the bed, sofa, or car seat. You 
know what we mean. Simple, everyday maneuvers that you once performed without a 
second thought--now require planning, calculation and contortions like a game of 
Twister.</P>
<P>Arthritics, people with injuries, or simply others who have trouble moving 
around have for years been ""making do"" with aids to assist them in moving 
around. If you don't have these issues, you may still be fostering the illusion 
that everyone walks, rises, twists, and sits with zero pain and discomfort--all 
because the world is designed around you. </P>
<P>Mobility aids must be permanent, safe, and designed exactly for the purpose 
of helping you move around. No ad hoc mobility aids anymore, please. So let's 
put an end to those not-so-graceful dance moves that cause pain and 
discomfort:</P>
<H3>The ""Out of Bed"" Ballet</H3>
<P>You're in bed but you don't want to be. The bed seems to have a mind of its 
own. Time was, you would practically leap out of bed. Now moving out of bed 
consists of well-laid plans involving hands and legs moving in coordinated 
patterns. Bed manufacturers only seem to consider highly-mobile persons when 
they design their beds. Naturally, because this is a bed, surfaces are smooth 
and soft--no grip bar, nothing solid! </P>
<P>Instead, use <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/919083"" target=""_blank"">mobility 
devices for beds</A>, such as wide-handled bed canes, transfer handles, or 
easy-grip bed caddies to ease yourself out of bed--without any crazy moves.</P>
<H3>The Bedside Twirl</H3>
<P>Now out of bed, you may want to transfer to a wheelchair? Not so easy if you 
have hip or leg troubles. A transfer pivot is just what you need to avoid having 
to perform The Bedside Twirl.</P>
<H3>The Easy Chair Can-Can Kick</H3>
<P>Find it nearly impossible to get out of the easy chair or sofa because there 
is nothing solid to grip onto? Instead of grabbing thin air or over-exerting 
painful legs, grip onto a <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/919083"" target=""_blank"">sturdy 
transfer bar</A> or use furniture risers to raise your chair just enough to make 
it easier.</P>
<H3>The Car Seat Twist and Shout</H3>
<P>Shout of <I>pain</I>, we should add. That aching twist and shift out of car 
seats is best performed with <A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/919083"" target=""_blank"">car 
mobility aids</A> such as a swivel seat cushion.</P>
<H3>The Sofa Glissade</H3>
<P>A ballet glissade--or glide--is best performed in a theater. Not in your 
house. Slide smoothly between soft, uneven surfaces with flat transfer boards 
made especially for this maneuver.</P>
<H3>Finale: The Overhead Lift</H3>
<P>You may be performing with a dance partner--that is, a helpful spouse or 
caregiver. Instead of taxing their aching backs, gait belts and transfer slings 
help them to assist you in moving from place to place.</P>

Fits ANY vehicle! 

Don’t you wish that parking tag of yours would just slip on and off your mirror as easy as a warm knife cuts butter? Well now, for less than the price of a coffee and donut, it can. 

Invented by a handicapped placard owner who became very frustrated every time he tried to hang his parking tag from the mirror, this ingenious product has made life a lot easier for many people. 

As you know, the mirror arm that these parking tags hang from cannot be seen from the driver’s seat. That means you have to lean forward, crank your head and neck and basically twist your body into positions it was never designed to be in just so you can see where to hang your tag. 

You know what I’m talking about. It’s a real pain in the ‘you know what’. 

Some folks are so bothered by the pain and struggle of hanging their placards, they just leave them up all the time. Maybe you know someone who drives around with their handicapped placard hanging off the mirror. Maybe you’ve even done it yourself.

By returning the cup to its upright position, the chamber is refilled and ready to deliver another 5 or 10 cc. The Provale cup encourages normal drinking habits and small swallows.

The Provale Cup consists of 3 parts: the inner cup, the mid cup and the outer cup. The design of inner cup lid provides very good nose clearance which allows patients to keep their chin in a proper position to make a good swallow.

It is easy to disassemble for cleaning and is dishwasher safe. <br><br>
Two handles are included with the Provale Cup. Choose how many handles are to be attached. The cup can be used with no handles, one handle or two handles. Once the handles are attached, they cannot be removed from the cup.

See our pressure prevention products at <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/45020"" target=""_blank"">CaregiverProducts.com</a>

<b>I. Risk Assessment</b>

1. Consider all bed- or chair-bound persons, or those whose ability to reposition is impaired, to be at risk for pressure ulcers.
2. Select and use a method of risk assessment, such as the Norton Scale or the Braden Scale, that ensures systematic evaluation of individual risk factors.
3. Assess all at-risk patients at the time of admission to health care facilities and at regular intervals thereafter.
4. Identify all individual risk factors (decreased mental status, moisture, incontinence, nutritional deficits) to direct specific preventive treatments. Modify care according to the individual factors.

<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/product/CTD21041"" target=""_blank"">Triderma MD® Pressure Sore Relief</a> concentrated cream is specifically formulated to help promote fast healing for minor to severely damaged skin from pressures, skin breakdown or other hard to heal skin irritations.

<b>II. Skin Care and Early Treatment</b>

1. Inspect the skin at least daily, and document assessment results.
2. Individualize bathing frequency. Use a mild cleansing agent. Avoid hot water and excessive friction.
3. Assess and treat incontinence. When incontinence cannot be controlled, cleanse skin at time of soiling, use a topical moisture barrier, and select underpads or briefs that are absorbent and provide a quick drying surface to the skin.
4. Use moisturizers for dry skin. Minimize environmental factors leading to dry skin such as low humidity and cold air.
5. Avoid massage over bony prominences.
6. Use proper positioning, transferring, and turning techniques to minimize skin injury due to friction and shear forces.
7. Use dry lubricants (cornstarch) or protective coverings to reduce friction injury.
8. Identify and correct factors compromising protein/calorie intake and consider nutritional supplementation/
support for nutritionally compromised persons.
9. Institute a rehabilitation program to maintain or improve mobility/activity status.
10. Monitor and document interventions and outcomes.

<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/product/CTD09041"" target=""_blank"">Triderma MD® Intense Healing Cream</a> is a specialized formula to soothe, protect and promote fast healing for hard to heal skin irritations.

<b>III. Mechanical Loading and Support Surfaces</b>

1. Reposition bed-bound persons at least every 2 hours, chair-bound persons every hour.
2. Use a written repositioning schedule.
3. Place at-risk persons on a pressure-reducing mattress/chair cushion. Do not use donut-type devices.
4. Consider postural alignment, distribution of weight, balance and stability, and pressure relief when positioning persons in chairs or wheelchairs.
5. Teach chair-bound persons, who are able, to shift weight every 15 minutes.
6. Use lifting devices (e.g., trapeze or bed linen) to move rather than drag persons during transfers and position changes.
7. Use pillows or foam wedges to keep boney prominences such as knees and ankles from direct contact with each other.
8. Use devices that totally relieve pressure on the heels (e.g., place pillows under the calf to raise the heels off the bed).
9. Avoid positioning directly on the trochanter when using the side-lying position (use the 30° lateral inclined position).
10. Elevate the head of the bed as little (maximum 30° angle) and for as short a time as possible.

The <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/product/CAC63"" target=""_blank"">Akton Mattress Overlays</a> are used by hospitals and long term care facilities as a significant component in prevention and treatment of decubitus ulcers.

The <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/product/CAC"" target=""_blank"">Akton Polymer Adaptive Flat Pads</a> have multifunctional applications for traditional and non-traditional seating challenges.

<b>IV. Education</b>

1. Implement educational programs for the prevention of pressure ulcers that are structured, organized, comprehensive, and directed at all levels of health care providers, patients, family, and caregivers.

2. Include information on:
a. etiology of and risk factors for pressure ulcers,
b. risk assessment tools and their application,
c. skin assessment,
d. selection/use of support surfaces,
e. development/implementation of individualized programs of skin care,
f. demonstration of positioning to decrease risk of tissue breakdown, and
g. accurate documentation of pertinent data.

3. Include built-in mechanisms to evaluate program effectiveness in preventing pressure ulcers.

Testimonials:

""This is the best pillow I have ever used as a CPAP patient! It’s like having a Tempurpedic pillow, but custom-tailored for my CPAP mask. I found that I had proper neck support whether I slept on my side or on my back. I really like the elastic bands that allow the tubing to move with me as I change sleeping positions. The Cool-Max covering is also very comfortable. I also like the fact that this pillow is made in America."" -Debbie S. , Baltimore, MD 

""SIMPLY AWESOME!!! Psyche has developed a true memory foam, side sleeper pillow. If that wasn’t good enough, the pillow also holds the tubing out of my way. I could sleep on my side or on my back, and my neck was supported in both positions. Great pillow!"" -Matt H., Dallas, TX

""This is the best pillow I have ever used as a CPAP patient! It’s like having a Tempurpedic pillow, but custom-tailored for my CPAP mask.

The Cool-Max covering is also very comfortable. I also like the fact that this pillow is made in America."" -Debbie S. , Baltimore, MD

<p>In instances, it appears that some types of arthritis can be curable.  Persons who develop a special type of arthritis caused by Lyme disease (which results from Lyme disease) may be cured by penicillin injections.</p>
<p>However, in most instances, the answer is &quot;No.&quot; At this point, there is no cure for arthritis.</p>
<p>The Greek word “arthron” means joint and the word “itis” means inflammation. So, arthritis is an inflammation of the joints. Cartilage, that smooth, soft tissue between the joints, begins to break down, and the joints rub against each other and cause this inflammation.</p>
<p>Sometimes what appears to be arthritis is really something else. Previously broken bones, infections, being overweight, injuries from repetitive motions, and other ailments may appear to be arthritis.</p>
<p>Since there is no cure for arthritis, doctors prescribe treatments that will lessen the pain and discomfort of arthritis. Tylenol, aspirin, and ibuprofen are but a few of the non-prescription drugs that your doctor may 
recommend. Other medicines that your doctor may prescribe include 
<span class=""minusOne"">cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, steroids, and anti-biologics. Surgery is an option is some instances.</span></p>
<p><span class=""minusOne"">But what physicians recommend most are <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/53736"" target=""_blank"">effective 
pain-lessening treatments for the arthritis</a>. These treatments falls into four basic categories: softness, application of heat, moistness, and support.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class=""minusOne"">Softness: We are all affected by gravity, and no one more so than arthritic persons. Even typically &quot;soft&quot; activities such as laying down or sitting often become unbearable for persons suffering from arthritics. Soothing, plush cushion, pillows, and pads are very effective for lessening pain caused by arthritis.</span></li>
<li><span class=""minusOne"">Heat: Mild heat, properly applied, can also ease pain caused by arthritis. Old methods of applying heat included hot water bottles and heating pads, but newer methods have come along which provide for safer, more consistent application of heat. One method is called MediBeads--microwavable wraps and pads that are ready in less than one minute, but provide up to 30 minutes of relief.</span></li>
<li><span class=""minusOne"">Moistness: For the relief of joint inflammation, there is no better combination than heat and moistness. MediBeads draw ambient moisture from the air and distribute clean, comfortable moisture over the affected areas.</span></li>
<li><span class=""minusOne"">Support: Because the movement of joints causes the pain associated with arthritis, sometimes the solution is to limit movement. A variety of splints, supports, slings, and wraps are available to support problem areas like wrists, hands, ankles, and shoulders.</span></li></ul>

difficulties resort to impromptu and often unsafe means of dealing with everyday 
tasks around the house. Simply put, most houses and apartments were 
designed for people with a greater range of mobility. If you have any type 
of mobility difficulty, you will find that you can bridge this gap with a wide 
assortment of assistive devices to help you get around with ease.</p>
<p>Following are some common household scenarios that may be unsafe, difficult, 
or just plain hard--along with quick fixes for each one:</p>
<h3>Lamps Too Difficult to Turn Off</h3>
<p>Raymond, who suffers from arthritis, finds it impossible to switch off his 
lamps every night. Since he often forgets to ask his son to do this before 
he leaves for the evening, Raymond leaves the lamp burning all night--or, 
worse, ""switches it off"" by yanking out the cord.</p>
<p>Quick Fix: </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/doknandlaswt.html"">Switch enlargers and 
grippers</a> are available to help with the painful task of turning difficult 
lamp switches.</p>
<h3>Fewer Handwritten Notes</h3>
<p>Mary loves to write notes and letters by hand to her grandchildren. Yet 
she finds it increasingly difficult to hold pens, and she will not resort to a 
typewriter or computer--she likes the personal touch of the hand-written note. 
As a result, she must ask her caregiver to write the occasional note for her.</p>
<p>Quick Fix:</p>
<p>Mary should first try <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/writingaids.html"">
soft, ergonomically correct pens</a> that ease the pain in her fingers. 
Should that prove to be too difficult,
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/writingaids.html"">writing clips and supports
</a>are available which take <i>all of the pressure</i> off of the fingers, 
allowing the hand to do most of the work.</p>
<h3>Walls Switches Too High</h3>
<p>John is a wheelchair user who has difficulty lifting his arms. He finds 
that he can no longer reach his wall-mounted light switches. The building 
superintendent was supposed to move the switches months ago, but John is still 
waiting for this to be done. Instead, he uses a yardstick to flip the 
switches. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. </p>
<p>Quick Fix:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/waswexha.html"">Wall switch extensions</a> 
provide an extra twelve inches of reach--easy for John to flip on and off. 
Now he can use the yardstick for measuring!</p>
<h3>Using Razor Blades Instead of Scissors</h3>
<p>Leigh enjoys scrapbooking. But lately she can no longer operate a pair 
of scissors. Since it is practically impossible to scrapbook without some 
type of cutting device, she has resorted to using a box-cutter. While this 
is easy to grip, she is nervous that one day she will cut herself.</p>
<p>Quick Fix: </p>
<p>Leigh should toss the box-cutter away and take advantage of
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adsc1.html"">adapted scissors</a> made 
especially for people who have limited hand strength. These scissors have 
extra-large grips, are self-opening, and there is even a brand of scissors that 
is table-mounted!</p>

People who have Alzheimer’s disease experience impairments not only in their cognitive abilities but also in their physiological status.  Approximately 40% of Alzheimer’s patients experience significant weight loss.  This weight loss may be due to many different factors but a study out of Boston University suggests that significant weight loss is due in part to the loss of the ability to distinguish contrast between colors.

People with Alzheimer's are not able to distinguish light colored food and drink on or in typically light colored tableware. When using tableware that offered a high contrast to the food and drink (i.e.: bright red and bright blue), researchers noticed that the participants in the study increased their food intake by 24% and liquid intake by 84%.

returnpolicy,"returnpolicy",,,No,,,No,"ordering information","Usually ships the next business day",,"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/makinglifeeasier/",,,,"health care products",,"Ordering Information",No,,,"<b>Do You Have a Return Policy?</b>

Yes, we are pleased to offer a Return Policy.  Because we offer only high-quality merchandise, we find that we have remarkably low return rates.  However, we recognize that there may be cases in which a customer feels the need to return a product—and we want to meet that need in a way that exceeds industry standards.

<b>May I Return My Order?</b>

In many cases, yes.  We believe that trust is the cornerstone of business.  A fair and honest Return Policy ensures that customers feel comfortable with their purchases and with us.  Therefore, we make every effort to ensure that all products that possibly can be safely returned will be returnable.  But it is important to note that not all products are returnable.

<b>Why Are Some Products Non-Returnable?</b>

Due to the unique nature of this business and related matters of hygiene and public safety, we cannot allow certain items to be returned.  The Federal Drug and Food Administration administers rules concerning the reprocessing of medical devices, a complex issue that the FDA has grappled with for many years.

We are not alone; other medical suppliers face the same obstacles.  If it were entirely our decision, we would make all products returnable.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.

<b>How Do I Determine if a Product is Returnable?</b>

Call us first and a Customer Service Representative (CSR) will be happy to help you make that determination.  If you return a product without first contacting us, you will not receive a refund, and the product might even be lost in transit.  Even if a CSR has previously approved return of a product, we reserve the right to refuse a refund based on the condition of the received merchandise.

<b>How Do I Make a Return?</b>

Contact us within the Return Period.  We will issue you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA).  All merchandise must be shipped back in its original packaging and the packaging must not be defaced in any way.  All parts and instructions must be returned.  All returns must be accompanied by a copy of your invoice.  The merchandise must be unused and in its original packaging.

<b>Where Do I Write the RMA?</b>

On the shipping label on the outside of your shipment.  Make certain that the RMA is written in clear, legible fashion for easier tracking.

<b>What is the Return Period?</b>

Within thirty (30) days of the date that you receive your product.

<b>May I Return a Product Without an RMA?</b>

No.  The RMA facilitates tracking of your returned product and expedites your refund.  We receive a high volume of shipments of all types every day, and it is extremely difficult to track all incoming packages without tracking codes.  

Please note that refunds for merchandise returned without RMAs will be denied.

<b>How Long Does the RMA Last?</b>

The RMA is effective for seven (7) days after you receive it.  After that time, you will need to obtain another RMA as long as you are still within the Return Period.  Outside of the Return Period, the products cannot be returned.

<b>In What Form Will I Receive My Refund?</b>

This is at our discretion.  Generally, a merchandise credit or an exchange credit will be applied to your account. The exchange credit will be valid up to 6 months after issue. If receiving a refund, please allow 6-8 weeks (two billing cycles) for the credit to process to your account.  Return Service Fees will be deducted from the value of your refund.

<b>Are Shipping and Handling Charges Refundable?</b>

No.

<b>Which Products Are Not Returnable?</b>

Call us first and a Customer Service Representative (CSR) will be happy to help you make that determination.  Merchandise that typically is non-returnable includes:
<ul>
<li>Eating products - Non returnable if packaging is opened.</li>
<li>Hygiene products - Non returnable if packaging is opened.</li>
<li>Mouth stick products - Non returnable if packaging is opened.</li>
<li>Toileting Products - Non returnable if packaging is opened.</li>
<li>Braces, Splints - Non returnable if packaging is opened.</li>
<li>Pillows - Non returnable if packaging is opened.</li>
<li>Bathing Products - Non returnable if packaging is opened.</li>
<li>Gel Mattress overlays - Non returnable.</li>
<li>Gel Cushions - Non returnable.</li>
<li>Skin Cream, Lotions - Non returnable.</li>
</ul>
Skin salves, ointments, creams and lotions: For your safety, we maintain strict security over our inventory of skin care products to avoid contamination or product tampering. To maintain this security no skin gels or lotions may be returned or exchanged once delivered. Be assured you will never receive a product that has not been handled by anyone other than the manufacturer and our shipping staff.

Pillows, orthopedic soft goods, supports, braces and other non-returnable health care items.  For your safety and protection, regional health laws and hygienic concerns render us unable to accept returns on all pillow products, orthopedic soft goods, braces, supports, hot/cold therapy items, other health care items once it is evident the item has been opened, used or worn.  We truly regret the strictness of this policy, but require it to ensure the safety and hygienic integrity of the products we sell for all our customers. We know you wouldn't want us to send you a used health care product . 

Other items may also be non-returnable.  Your CSR can help you determine if your product is returnable.

All merchandise must be shipped back in its original packaging and the packaging must not be defaced in any way.  All parts and instructions must be returned.  All returns must be accompanied by a copy of your invoice.  The merchandise must be unused and in its original packaging.

<b>Do You Have a Return Service Fee Policy?</b>

Yes.  Returns and refunds impose an extra workload on our part.  Rather than pass this cost onto the consumer through higher product prices, we are consistent with others within our industry by requiring nominal service fees in the event of returns.

A service fee of 20% is required for most items.  Items shipped directly from the manufacturer require a service fee of up to 30%, per manufacturers’ requirements.

many misconceptions about effective treatments for this often debilitating 
condition. We would like to clear up a few misguided ideas about arthritis 
treatments, and hopefully pave the way to healthy solutions for persons who 
suffer from arthritis.</span></p>
<h3><span class=""minusOne"">Myth: Arthritis pain must be tolerated; there 
is no cure for arthritis.</span></h3>
<p><span class=""minusOne"">Fact: False. While it is true that there 
is currently no cure for arthritis, the pain associated with arthritis can 
indeed be managed effectively. One of the most common sources of pain is 
related to sitting or lying down--both of which put stress on inflamed joints.
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461379"" target=""_blank"">Special 
arthritic pillows</a> are available to dramatically ease this pain. </span></p>
<h3><span class=""minusOne"">Myth: Many of the old-fashioned arthritis 
treatments don't work very well.</span></h3>
<p><span class=""minusOne"">Fact: Partially true. As medical science 
evolves, the treatment of arthritic pain also evolves. Old-fashioned 
heating pads and hot water bottles still provide some degree of relief from 
discomfort. But these treatments can be improved on by a remarkable new 
technology called
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461360"" target=""_blank"">MediBeads</a>. 
Essentially, MediBeads provides the same soothing comfort--heat and moisture--but 
is 
cleaner, easier to prepare, and remains warmer longer than the old-fashioned 
methods.</span></p>
<h3><span class=""minusOne"">Myth: Herbal arthritic treatments are the best 
cures for arthritic pain.</span></h3>
<p><span class=""minusOne"">Fact: False. As of this time, herbal 
treatments have not been proven to reduce the inflammation associated with 
arthritis. The best non-prescription medicines recommended by doctors are: 
aspirin, ibuprofen, and Tylenol. Doctors also recommend
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461374"" target=""_blank"">special gel 
cushions</a> to make sitting and resting easier and
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461379"" target=""_blank"">
activity-specific pillows and pads</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span class=""minusOne"">Myth: Splints are only for broken bones.</span></h3>
<p><span class=""minusOne"">Fact: False. While splints are commonly 
associated with broken bones, they are also used to treat arthritic pain. 
The &quot;splint&quot; category encompasses many different aids:
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461357"" target=""_blank"">comfortable 
wraps, gloves, slings</a> specially designed to limit the range of motion that 
causes joint inflammation.</span></p>
<h3><span class=""minusOne"">Myth: Those super-comfortable high-tech bed 
pads are available only to hospitals and institutions.</span></h3>
<p><span class=""minusOne"">Fact: False.
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461374"" target=""_blank"">Yes, Akton 
mattress overlays</a> are often associated with large medical facilities. 
But these sophisticated 100% polymer overlays are now available to the consumer 
market.</span></p>
<h3><span class=""minusOne"">Myth: Heat packs are expensive.</span></h3>
<p><span class=""minusOne"">Fact: True and false. Those one-time-use, 
disposable heat packs certainly do get expensive. But
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461360"" target=""_blank"">MediBeads 
heat packs</a> are fully reusable, rechargable, and washable.</span></p>
<h3><span class=""minusOne"">Myth: Arthritis can affect anyone, regardless 
of age.</span></h3>
<p><span class=""minusOne"">Fact: True. Though most commonly 
associated with the elderly, arthritis can affect people of different ages, 
genders, and race.</span></p>

<center><B><FONT SIZE=5>Gadgets for the Elderly</B></FONT></B></center>

As we age, and the execution of things we once took for granted becomes more difficult, the desire to maintain our independence becomes very important. Needing assistance from others in order to perform simple, everyday actions is not something we look forward to. Luckily, there are people looking for new ways to extend our independence indefinitely. Joy Loverde is here today to discuss some “Golden Gadgets,” everyday items with senior-sensitive enhancements that can sustain self-reliance in the later stages of life.

The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/ringpen.html"" target=""_blank"">RING PEN</a> takes most of the 'shake' and muscle pain out of handling a pen. One finger through the ring creates a solid grip and the ergonomically designed barrel provides a natural resting place for the writing finger. Barrel fits snuggly between two other fingers. No pressure, no pain.

“Golden Gadgets” are devices that facilitate the operation of seemingly simple tasks that are commonly taken for granted when we are younger. Due to reduced or limited dexterity or eyesight, things like replacing hearing aid batteries or dialing the phone may get progressively harder as we age. These devices can even restore our ability to perform those common tasks that may have become difficult in recent years, such as writing by hand, cutting a sheet of paper or unlocking the front door.

The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/keyturners.html"" target=""_blank"">KEY TURNER</a> is ideal for people with limited hand strength or coordination. These heavy-duty key turners provide increased leverage to turn a key with a comfortable grip. Fold keys into handle when not in use.

This is not to say that these products work toward keeping seniors away from other people. One device in particular works to help seniors stay better connected with their friends and loved ones. The Amplified Photo Phone has a very large number pad to assist those with vision problems, as well as a very loud ring and flashing red light if you are hard of hearing. If you have trouble remembering certain numbers, you can program contact info into the speed dial, which can store numbers next to a picture of the person you mean to call. 

Personal communication through handwriting is also very important for maintaining independence. The Ring Pen and Neo Bird Pen assist those with difficulty grasping a normal pen by easing the strain on the hands and using the weight of the wrist, hand, and forearm to guide the pen along the page. With the help of these inventive writing utensils, you can continue to personally express yourself rather than relying on someone else to write your checks and letters.

The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/neobird.html"" target=""_blank"""">NEO BIRD WRITING PEN</a> is a great relief for people with arthritis or hand ailments or injuries. The unique, patented design of this innovation in writing instruments allows the weight of your hand to work for you, not against you.

The Golden Gadgets can even help out in the kitchen! If you have trouble grasping and controlling normal utensils, there are spoons, forks, and knives available with enlarged handles for easy gripping. They can also be bent depending on which hand you wish to use them with. If you suffer from more severe arthritis, the Universal Elastic Cuff is available. You can slide regular utensils into this handy sleeve and guide them normally, thereby eliminating the need to grasp anything too tightly.

The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adaptedknives.html""  target=""_blank"">GOOD GRIPS ROCKER KNIFE</a> with Serrated Blade is ideal for cutting meats. Requires only minimal arm strength for cutting. An extended safety cap protects fingers while cutting.

The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/utensilholders.html""  target=""_blank"">UNIVERSAL ELASTIC CUFF</a> holds various utensils. Elastic strap slides on for a secure fit. Slide eating utensils into the fixed pocket. Ideal for someone with limited or no grasp.

The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adeaut.html""  target=""_blank"">GOOD GRIPS UTENSILS</a> have a soft, cushion grip that keeps the utensil in the hand–even when wet! The large, easy-to-hold handles are made of a rubber-like material, with flexible ribbing that’s comfortable to hold and adapts to any grip.

The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/spreadboard.html"" target=""_blank"">SPREADBOARD</a> holds bread in place while spreading jam, butter, or whatever you choose. Two plastic guards hold food in place. A lip on the back edge hooks over the work surface to keep the Spreadboard from moving during use.

These are just a few of the many objects out there designed to assist the visually, aurally, and physically impaired, and with an increasing number of people reaching an age where they may begin to require a little help once in awhile, there are sure to be many more on the way.

The Knork knife and fork combo utensil is also recognized as a daily living aid for people with limited hand mobility-- from temporary injuries such as sprains to permanent conditions such as severe arthritis. It can be invaluable to individuals with no use of one hand due to conditions such as hemi-paralysis and amputations. The Knork® has been implemented in rehabilitation centers and hospitals around the country. Individuals who would otherwise require that their food be cut for them-- or else greatly limit their meal choices-- can gain greater independence and freedom by using this remarkable eating tool.

This utensil is as safe to the mouth as a standard fork. The curved shape enables the head to be rocked back and forth in a motion that is very much like that of a rocking chair. It is the combination of the beveled edge and the rocking motion that gives the Knork® its amazing cutting ability.</li>
<li><b>The Finger Platform:</b> The Knork® has an enlarged finger platform located between the handle and head. When trying to cut foods using a regular fork, the finger can develop a painful ""indentation"" from pressing down on the side of the narrow handle or tines. When using the Knork®, the finger rests on the smooth, comfortable platform. It also reduces the effort needed to rock the head back and forth, creating the cutting motion. As a result, the Knork® can cut through tougher foods such as pizza.</li>

If you think that assistive bathing aids 
consist entirely of long-handled back scrubbers and plastic ""stickies"" for the 
bathtub floor, you've got another thing coming. Bathing aids have come a 
long way in the last five to ten years.</p>
<p>In fact, bathing aids have now come so far that it's possible for an elderly 
person, a person with arthritis, or someone who just has a difficult time 
tending to himself or herself--to bathe entirely unassisted by another person. 
Sound too good to be true? Well, check this out:</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/bathingaids.html"">Step 1: Shower 
or Bath? Think Safety and Comfort</a></h3>
<p>Before you even step into the shower or bathtub, you need to feel safe and 
comfortable. Certainly you can add
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/bathingaids.html"">safety treads </a>to the 
slippery floor, if you wish; but there are many other ways you can feel 
comfortable. There are different grab bars available. A two-level 
grab bar slides right over the side of the tub, and allows you to have something 
stable to hold onto.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/bocalohahabo.html"">Step 2: Enjoy 
the Shower or Bath with Special Body and Hair Washing Aids</a></h3>
<p>Now that you're in the shower or bathtub, it's time to get wet! You'll 
be pleased to discover a 
special class of long-handled washing aids...custom-made for the bathtub or 
shower. Angled, ergonomically correct, light-weight, and with easy-to-hold 
soft ""grippy"" handles, these
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/bocalohahawa.html"">washers</a> are the 
perfect aids for cleaning your hair and body in either the bath or the shower.
</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/lohasp.html"">Step 3: In or Out of 
the Bath, Long-Handled Sponges and Brushes</a></h3>
<p>You say you still want the <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/lohasp.html"">
long-handled back scrubbers</a>? You've got 'em. But it's far more 
than just that. You've got brushes that help you wash under your 
toes--without having to bend over. And then there are long-handled lotion 
applicators, and long-handled foot brushes, and long-handled sponges. 
Practically every bathing implement you can imagine--but with a long handle 
attached to it! Imagine that!</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/orhyai.html"">Step 4: Brushing and 
Flossing Aids</a></h3>
<p>Out of the shower and dried off, it's time to brush and floss. Is there 
anything more difficult than grasping two ends of dental floss? Easy to

<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/nailcareaids.html"">Step 5: 
Manicure and Pedicure Assistance</a></h3>
<p>Nail clippers, files, and brushes are small, difficult to operate, and have a 
tendency to slip. The best solution for these problems is to widen and 
lengthen the clipper handles, and give them soft indentations that fit your 
thumb. These <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/nailcareaids.html"">
easy-to-grip nail clippers</a> are just the thing to get your nails trimmed with 
minimal fuss. If you still need more stability, you'll want to use
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/nailcareaids.html"">clippers securely mounted 
to a non-slip clipper board</a>. And don't forget the toes. 
Long-reach toenail clippers extend your reach and help you get within eight 
inches of your feet, for easy clipping action.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/bocalohabran1.html"">Step 6: Brush 
and Comb Your Hair with Extended Grooming Aids</a></h3>
<p>You may find it difficult to bend down to reach your feet or even reach back 
to thread on a belt. But what can be more difficult for persons with 
mobility challenges than to<i> reach up </i>and brush or comb one's hair? 
This is one area where folks often need to ask a spouse or caregiver for 
assistance--yet it's also a very personal task that most people prefer to do by 
themselves. Do it yourself with
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/bocalohabran1.html"">extended brushes and 
combs</a> that lengthen your reach up to fourteen inches. Soft, non-slip 
handles and smart designs always make these grooming aids a pleasure to use.</p>

You like spending time with family and 
friends, and what better way to pass your time with people you enjoy than to 
break bread together?</p>
<p>Food has long been a favorite way to bring people together. Meals act as 
a convenient pretext for people to spend time together, and meals allow people 
to see each other in their most raw, unadorned state.</p>
<p>If you are elderly, disabled, or simply find mealtimes difficult--why should 
you miss out on all the joy, laughter, and conversation? No need to, 
though, if you take <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/inkitchen.html"">
advantage of assistive devices for mealtimes</a>.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adplplguandb.html"">Adapted Bowls and 
Plates</a></h3>
<p>Since when did food develop a mind of its own? This certainly seems to 
be the case when peas choose to roll off the plate; when meatloaf decides to 
&quot;loaf&quot; on the plate and not meet your mouth; when mandarin oranges or mango slip 
around. Plates and bowls are simply not ergonomically designed--whether or 
not you have physical challenges.</p>
<p>But <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adplplguandb.html"">adapted bowls and 
plates</a> are smart. They have partitions to keep the corn away from the 
potatoes; lips and guards to prevent food from sliding off the side; and 
ingenious warmers activated by hot water to keep everything toasty.</p>
<p>Or is it the plate and bowl itself that seems to slide around? Now 
there are <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/adplplguandb.html"">plates with 
suction-padded bases</a> to keep the dish firm and steady while you cut or scoop 
your food.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/spreadboard.html"">Spreading Raspberry 
Jam and Bread?</a></h3>
<p>So this brings up a more vital question. You're out to breakfast with 
some good friends. You order toast, and your lips are already watering as 
you contemplate the tasty raspberry jam. Question is: how do you 
spread the jam, without the bread sliding all over?</p>
<p>Simple. You've got a
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/spreadboard.html"">clever little device 
called a Spreadboard</a> tucked away in your purse. Two lips hook over the 
side of the table, while on top there are two guards that hold the bread in 
place. Spread away! One hand is all you need.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/utensilholders.html"">Have Trouble 
Holding Your Fork? Help is On the Way!</a></h3>
<p>Forks, knives, and spoons seem almost diabolically designed to tax a 
person's hand strength. Persons with arthritis especially find it 
difficult to hold onto a fork for any extended period of time--if at all.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of adapted eating devices are well aware of this, and have 
pulled out all stops to provide a wide variety of
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/utensilholders.html"">straps, clips, and 
holders to assist with handling eating utensils</a>. Most of these holders 
are so efficient that <i>no finger strength at all is needed</i>: the hand 
and the holder alone do the work.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/dynoma.html"">Mats for Eating...And for 
Afterwards</a></h3>
<p>Finally, if you don't need anything like the suction-based plates or bowls, 
you might find the <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/dynoma.html"">non-slip 
mats</a> to be quite useful. These are &quot;grippy&quot; (but not sticky) surfaces 
for your plate or bowl, and a neat way to clean up after your meal. Best 
thing about them is they can be used for other activities after your meal: 
playing cards, writing, or using the telephone or calculator. </p>

MediBeads are microwave activated moist heat wraps that deliver immediate pain relieving moist heat therapy. These moist heat wraps are ready for use in just minutes, and continue to deliver therapeutic moist heat for up to thirty minutes.  
<br><br>
Through a patent pending process, the beads in MediBeads continuously absorb water molecules from the air. Adding water is not necessary. The absorbed water is held, purified and released as ""clean moist heat"" when the MediBeads Wrap is microwaved. The result is a bacteria and odor-free wrap. Unlike other grain and pellet products, MediBeads need no special covers, they will not dry out, dissolve or disintegrate. MediBeads Wraps are washable, so no special covers are required.
<br><br>
When removed from the microwave, the temperature of MediBeads Wrap does not increase. This prevents inadvertent burns, which are caused by the continued temperature increase (""cooking"") prevalent in all gel packs. Microwave activation eliminates potentially dangerous use of boiling water, electricity or ovens. MediBeads are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, easy to use and portable.

<p>It all starts by getting rid of what you don&#8217;t need. That means trimming your toenails and clearing away dry, excess skin. It can be quite a pain (literally!) to clip brittle toenails. But the ergonomic <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/evolution-toenail-clippers.html"">Evolution Toenail Clippers</a> can make it much easier. They offer a design that gives you a better grip and stronger cutting power. If you have thick, very curved, or brittle toenails, you&#8217;ll enjoy clean cut of the Japanese stainless steel blades and the wide jaw opening.</p>

<p>As we age, our feet tend to get dry and even callused. The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/evolution-foot-smoother.html"">Evolution Foot Smoother</a> helps you get rid of dry, callused skin&#8211;gently. It features a multi-directional stainless steel surface that allows you to smooth your foot up and down, side to side, or in gentle circles. The emery grit on the back polishes any rough spots and the catcher traps smooth-off skin until you&#8217;re ready to dispose of it.</p>
<h3>Clean and caress</h3>
<p>The next step in keeping those feet cool and cared for in the summer is cleaning and stimulating them. The <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/sosoelfobr.html"">Soapy Soles Elite</a> is a 3-in-1 foot care product that will do just that. It has three different surfaces that allows you to clean, massage, and stimulate your feet &#8212; all without bending over! That&#8217;s because the Soapy Soles Elite suctions to the bathtub (or shower) floor. No bending over and no slipping.</p>

<p>The center oval consists of nodes or &#8220;bumps&#8221; that you can use to massage your feet. It&#8217;s also great for relieving stress. The center oval detaches so that you can replace it with the <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/sosoelpuin.html"">Elite Pumice Insert</a> or the <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/sosoelsodiin.html"">Elite Soap Dispenser</a>. Use the pumice to exfoliate or use the soap dispenser to apply soap without bending over.</p>

<b>SUNzyme</b> neutralizes Malodors. Malodors themselves are very volatile and light within the atmosphere. As a result, the malodor permeates throughout the entire atmosphere, first, causing unpleasantness then coming into direct contact with the olfactory senses. When SUNzyme encounters malodors, either static or airborne, it combines with them in the atmosphere forming a neutral substance. Due to the high molecular weight of both the malodor and SUNzyme, they fall to a lower atmospheric level and biodegrade naturally. “Biodegradable” refers to the microorganisms in the environment which break down the SUNzyme. When SUNzyme and malodor fall to a lower atmospheric level, the microorganisms break down the encapsulated molecules. As a result of this biomolecular activity, normal air quality is restored. In many areas where SUNzyme is used continuously, a residual effect will impede the reoccurrence of the odor. SUNzyme may be sprayed into the air or directly onto surfaces. The surfactants in SUNzyme, by nature, are water soluble and biodegradable. SUNzyme can be diluted from a concentrated form and can be used as a process addition to existing products. 

<b>SUNzyme</b> dispels the common misconception that industrial perfumes will contribute to eliminating odors. Industrial perfumes, otherwise known as masking agents, simply sit on odors and when the initial effect has worn off, the odor still exists and is even enhanced. The total odor level is increased to and overwhelming sensation which confuses the olfactory senses so it does not recognize the malodor. These masking agents are based on the premise that people perceive a mixture of smells as a single odor. They include compounds such as aromatics, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, and terpenes, all of which are dangerous to our well being. 

<b>SUNzyme</b>, on the other hand, efficiently eliminates organic odors with organics. What actually cause the odor is organic matter decomposing. The typical odor causing molecule derives from oxygen, water, bacteria, and organic matter decomposing together. As a matter of decomposing, it emits gaseous odor. This is the unpleasant odor we smell. 

<b>SUNzyme</b> is food grade approved, environmentally safe and user friendly, allowing the widest range of uses. The product will not contaminate the working environment even through misuse or the application equipment malfunction.

This award winning modular support system provides support and balance assistance to those who need extra help transitioning from a seated position to a standing position. The Super Bar unlocks and pivots freely to move with you step by step. The Super Bar locks every 45 degrees for stability during standing and sitting transfers. It automatically locks when released preventing forward or lateral falls, and provides full support when making two or three step transfers.
<br><br>
SuperPole is a secure structure that can be installed in minutes between a floor and ceiling and is held by a jackscrew expansion. The screw expands the pole to create enough tension between the floor and ceiling to hold the pole securely. Rubber pads on the ceiling plate and the floor plate hold the transfer pole in place and prevent marring of the ceiling or floor. Installs easily with no structural reinforcements needed. Foam hand grip provides a comfortable gripping surface, particularly useful for those with limited hand strength. Installs anywhere there is a floor and ceiling, placing transfer support directly where it is needed.
<br><br> 
Use the Super Pole with Super Bar beside a bed, bath, toilet or chair. It is more compact than a walker in small restricted areas such as washrooms, and is useful for pivot transfers in narrow areas such as between bed and wall, narrow hallways, etc. This transfer aid allows weight shift, moving, standing, leaving or getting into bed, or transfer to wheelchair, walker or bedside commode. In a shower, the Super Pole with Super Bar provides complete support for stepping over the tub wall without reaching for wall grab bars. The SuperBar can pivot away from shower curtains, allowing them to fully close during a shower. For toilet transfers, the Super Bar permits pulling up to standing and can provide leaning support while managing clothing.

""We tried the ""No Rinse"" shampoo and we all loved it. My daughter is severely handicapped and is completely dependent on our help for all her needs, which we are most happy to give. She is thirteen years old and we are blessed to be her parents. She does not like to be touched especially her head and never has. So you can just imagine how much fun bath time is. I was recently in the hospital and it was given to me as well as the bath wipes. I used the bath wipes while in the hospital and loved them. The shampoo I did not have a chance to use until now. I really did not think that it would work. I sure am happy that it does. Now we are stress free at bath time!"" KM/CA 

“I truly cannot ever remember using your No- Rinse Shampoo without whispering a silent ‘thank you’ for saving me so much time. A busy nurse does not have time for poor quality. I appreciate your high standards.” LS, RN, MSN (Wisconsin)

Thermoskin captures your body's heat and provides light, comfortable support.  This heat and gentle support work together to bring you natural temporary relief from arthritic pain.

Seasonal Affective Disorder, also known as SAD, winter blues, or seasonal depression, is a medical condition caused by the seasonal change in the amount of available sunlight. SAD (which affects as much as 10% of the population) is most pronounced in the more northern regions of the world, with a greater daylight variance from summer to winter. Women are affected to a larger degree than men (by almost 3 to 1). Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the individual case. In its milder form, “winter blues”, symptoms include a lack of energy, depression, listlessness, and food cravings for sweets and carbohydrates. By contrast, cases of the more debilitating Seasonal Affective Disorder may include additional symptoms: Problems sleeping, change in appetite or weight, loss of memory, lack of concentration, severe depression and confusion

Thermoskin is a new generation pain relief retainer containing material which not only captures and retains your body heat, but also allows your skin to ventilate and remain comfortably dry. 

Unique to Thermoskin is the patented Trioxon lining - which is soft against the skin and captures your natural body heat.

Thermoskin combines heat treatment with gentle support, which work together to give you temporary relief from arthritic pain. Thermoskin retains your own body heat to bring you soothing temporary relief without drugs, rubs, oils or ointments. 

Thermoskin applies heat continuously for a long period and during a range of activity levels. Unlike traditional heat treatment (which requires you to be immobile) Thermoskin can be worn and used as part of an active life.

Thermoskin has been designed to be easy to position, easy to adjust, comfortable to wear and removable with minimum stress and body movement. It wraps around and secures with flexible Velcro fastenings.

The anatomical shape means Thermoskin fits snugly and comfortably. Seams and hems are overlooked flat. There are no welted ridges to cause discomfort.

Thermoskin provides gentle, comfortable, light support. It is designed to be worn for long stretches at a time. At night, it can help the arthritic sufferer get a comfortable night's sleep. During the day, it can help increase mobility.

This is a toilet seat riser that you install only once and that blends in with the bathroom. It was created to solve the problems created by those old, clunky disabled toilet seats.

There have always been a range of handicapped and disabled toilet seats on the market. But until now, users of these toilet seat risers had to compromise their comfort and dignity. The old toilet seat risers were clunky, ugly and flimsy. They were unsanitary and hard to clean. And they were a pain to mount and remove after every use. In other words, there was plenty of room for improvement. 

The Easy Toilet Riser requires little additional cleaning. But most importantly, the Toilet Riser™ won’t force you to change your bathroom experience.

There are no new tools to use. No extra parts. You’ll get to use the same toilet you’re familiar with. The Easy Toilet Riser™ just boosts it a little higher.

The Easy Toilet Riser™ comes in a kit with everything you need for easy installation. Although The Medway Corporation Easy Toilet Riser™ ships in an 11 lb. package, the toilet seat riser is made with sturdy and high quality PVC strong enough to support up to 500 lbs.

want to do so</i>. As a caregiver, introducing adaptive dinnerware not 
only can you make your own job a bit easier, but you can give your patient or 
loved one a degree of freedom and power that they may not have felt for quite 
awhile.</p>
<p>The question is: What do they want? They may not always be able 
to voice their concerns, so it here is a list of the top 4 types of products 
that can make their lives more enjoyable, as well as your job easier:</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911594"" target=""_blank"">1. 
Adapted Plates and Bowls</a></h3>
<p>Eating can be a real problem. Food often refuses to stay on the plate; 
plates and bowls slide around; and food gets mixed up within the plate. 
These problems are instantly solved with adaptive dinnerware.</p>
<p>Folks who have difficulties eating love these wonderful aids. Rolling 
peas, sliding asparagus, and slipping spinach are all kept in check and 
corralled by special scooper plates. These
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911594"" target=""_blank"">scoopers</a> 
have partial lips around the rim to prevent food from sliding off. </p>
<p>But special plates are not always necessary. A wide variety of
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911594"" target=""_blank"">bumpers, 
guards, lips</a> are available that slip or clip onto nearly any type of plate 
to perform the same function as the scooper plates.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911661"" target=""_blank"">2. 
Non-Skid Plates and Bowls</a></h3>
<p>A good companion to the scoopers and plate guards mentioned above, non-skid 
plates are another favorite among people who have difficulties feeding 
themselves independently. </p>
<p>Essentially, there are three ways to keep plates and bowls from moving under 
the force of a eating utensils: mats, suction bases, and gripper feet.
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911661"" target=""_blank"">Mats and 
gripper feet</a> provide a good margin of safety, employing a very ""grippy"" (but 
not at all sticky) non-slip material to keep sliding plates and bowls to a 
minimum. If hand tremors are an issue, then the only true way to actually 
adhere a plate or bowl to a table is
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911661"" target=""_blank"">suction-based 
bowls and plates</a> that will <i>not move at all</i>. </p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/917990"" target=""_blank"">3. 
Weighted Utensils</a></h3>
<p>Who would ever think that weighted utensils could be so valuable? But 
if you have problems with hand tremors, you can easily see the value in such 
assistive aids.
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/917990"" target=""_blank"">Weighted 
knives, forks, and spoons</a> are available which help hold trembling hands 
steady when eating. If you don't want to buy a special set of utensils, 
your own utensils can be inserted into weighted holders that have a variety of 
functions--they can even be used for razors and toothbrushes.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911595"" target=""_blank"">4. 
Utensil Holders for Better Grip</a></h3>
<p>Utensils can be hard to grip for any period of time. To assist spouses 
or patients who cannot grip spoons, knives, and forks, there are
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/911595"" target=""_blank"">clips and 
straps</a> that <i>do the holding </i>for them. But it's not always 
necessary to use clips and straps. Sometimes it's enough just to ""fatten 
up"" the handles to make them easier to hold.

have a difficult time with fine motor skills, such as children--dressing oneself 
can be one of the hardest tasks in the day. While caregivers or spouses 
may assist with other difficult tasks, such as eating or transport, getting 
dressed is one of those very private activities that most people like to do by 
themselves!</p>
<p>Here is the countdown of the top 5 types of dressing aids that 
many mobility-impaired folks tend to favor:</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/myselfbelts.html"">#5: Adapted 
Belts</a></h3>
<p>Many people who have had strokes can use one hand quite well...but the other 
hand isn't up to the challenge. Most of our life's daily activities 
require the use of two hands. Persons who have the use of one hand appreciate the
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/myselfbelts.html"">one-handed belt</a>, a 
clever dressing aid that helps a person get dressed much faster than before.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/lohashho.html"">#4: Extended 
Shoehorns</a></h3>
<p>Unless you have a closet full of slippers and old loafers, chances are you 
need to bend far down to get your shoes on. The problem is that most 
style-conscious people need to wear something <i>other than</i> slippers and 
loafers! Women's pumps and men's lace-ups can be most difficult to get 
on--even with a shoehorn. That's why
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/lohashho.html"">extended and telescopic 
shoehorns</a> are the ticket. </p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/elsh.html"">#3: Elastic Shoelaces</a></h3>
<p>Elastic shoelaces fall into the ""Why Haven't I Always Used These?"" category. 
It's a mystery why anyone would even deal with traditional shoelaces once they 
try these <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/elsh.html"">elastic shoe laces</a> 
that let you dress in a snap (no pun intended!) They look wonderful and no 
one will ever notice that you don't have cloth shoelaces. You'll put on your 
shoes in half the time.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/soandstai.html"">#2: Help with 
Putting on Socks and Stockings</a></h3>
<p>Have you ever noticed how difficult it is for kids to learn how to put on 
socks? They even learn how to put on pants, underwear, and shoes long 
before they can master this exacting project. So, it should be no wonder 
that anyone who has difficulty with their hands, visual skills, and 
coordination--such as the elderly or arthritic persons--has a hard time 
with this. <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/soandstai.html"">Stocking 
and sock aids</a> help by forming the item into an open, rigid shape, and then 
by guiding the foot in. </p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/buandziai.html"">#1: Buttoning and 
Zipping Devices</a></h3>
<p>And the winner...? What is the single most frustrating clothing item to 
deal with if you have difficulty with your vision or with your grasp? If 
you guessed buttons and zippers, you're right. The manufacturers of 
assistive devices know what a pain it is to locate, grasp, and move those tiny 
zippers and buttons. As a result, there is a wide range of
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/buandziai.html"">rings, pulls, and grips for 
zippers and buttons</a> that let you dress with complete ease. If you 
prefer to do without zippers or buttons,
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/buandziai.html"">Velcro buttons</a> replace 
existing buttons and quickly stick together to hold clothing firmly in place.</p>

Many of the assistive devices already prescribed to you may not provide adequate 
comfort and relief from pain. </p>
<p>Folks just like you who happen to be suffering from pain related to age, 
illness, arthritis, or accidents have found smart ways to deal with this 
problem. They take advantage of a host of products that ease discomfort 
and help them feel good again. Here are some of the most popular products:</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/piandpo.html"">Sleeping Aids to Help You 
Wake Rested for the Day</a></h3>
<p>You cannot have a good day unless you have a deep restful sleep. You 
may be tossing and turning all night because your current bedding items are not 
designed for issues that may be affecting you. That's why there are
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/piandpo.html"">bed positioning and pillow 
aids</a> that help in many different ways: gently lifting your legs, 
separating knees, supporting your torso, aligning your body, and many other 
positions to assist you.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/memohewr.html"">Clean and Sanitary Moist 
Heat Compresses</a></h3>
<p>Have you tried to ease joint pain, sinus pressure, or headaches with various 
types of heat compresses? Haven't you always found them to be messy and 
unsanitary--and they lose their heat quickly? A
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/memohewr.html"">new type of compress, or wrap</a>, 
is available called MediBeads which warms gently in the microwave but cannot get 
too hot. MediBeads wraps don't need any water: they wick in water 
from the air. Enjoy the instant, hydrating, and clean comfort of MediBeads 
wraps.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/trmdthskpr.html"">Healing, Moisturizing, 
and Pressure Relief Cream</a></h3>
<p>Skin gets a real beating just by ordinary, everyday life: the sun, 
wind, and rain all contribute to premature aging, not to mention discomfort. 
Then, skin becomes even more damaged due to pressure from crutches, casts, and 
canes. You need a <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/trmdthskpr.html"">
special healing and moisturizing cream</a> that is nothing like the ordinary 
stuff found on drugstore shelves.
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/trmdthskpr.html"">Triderma MD<font face=""arial, helvetica"" size=""3"">®</font></a><font face=""arial, helvetica"" size=""3"">
</font>is specially formulated for people experiencing certain conditions 
such as eczema, pressure sores, wounds, rosacea, and other painful skin 
irritations.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/akpocu.html"">Soft, Resizable Polymer 
Pads</a></h3>
<p>If you're experiencing discomfort from splints, crutches, leg or head rests, 
or any other type of assistive device, then you may know that good padding can 
help you. There are special pads, called
<a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/akpocu.html"">Akton Polymer</a> pads, which 
come in a range of thicknesses and sizes. But the best thing about these 
polymer pads is that they can be cut to size with an ordinary pair of scissors. 
Even though the pads feel and appear to be filled with gel, they are made of a 
solid, cohesive polymer material which is both resistant to bacteria and germs 
and is fire-resistant.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/thwrandhasu.html"">Wrist, Hand, and Thumb 
Supports</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the hand support prescribed to you isn't providing enough support. 
If so, you'll find a <a href=""http://www.wrightstuff.biz/thwrandhasu.html"">range 
of soft wraps</a> for your thumb, hand, or wrist that are easy to put on and 
provide hours of comfort between changes.</p>

they're all about. Yes, they function as a mobility device to take a 
person from place to place. But they're far more than just that.</p>
<p>For people who need them, wheelchairs and walkers become very much an 
extension of their body. After all, there was a time when they could walk 
down the sidewalk or go across the street with ease--and with no help. 
Now, these people do the same task, but with the help of these aids. So, 
these are very personal devices, and often these devices require some adaptation to make 
them even more individualized.</p>
<p>Wheelchairs and walkers usually are delivered in ""stock"" condition. 
That is, with few bells and whistles and little accommodation for comfort. 
Users can greatly increase their level of comfort by adding
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">pads on 
walker handles and wheelchair rims</a>. Pads are available for the
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">seat and 
cushion</a>, too. (Note: even crutch users can purchase
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">soft gel pads</a> 
for the forearm, hand, and underarm areas).</p>
<p>While comfort is always a priority, functionality is another important issue. 
Most wheelchairs and walkers are not functional enough for most users' everyday 
needs. But wheelchairs and walkers can become functional by the addition of 
things like <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">
attachable carry-all pouches</a>. Folks who use both scooters and walkers 
can become ""hybrid"" users by employing a clever device called a
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">walker holder</a> 
that attaches to the back off the scooter.</p>
<p>Safety is the third issue. Nearly all wheelchairs, scooters, and 
walkers are engineered within a certain set of safety limitations. But 
users can increase the safety in a number of different ways. One way is to 
add a <a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">brake 
lever extension</a>. Brakes are the one way to ensure that the wheelchair 
will not roll away. Yet some people may avoid using the brakes because of 
limited hand and arm strength. Cupholders are another safety device. 
Hot liquids carried on a wheelchair or scooter user's lap is highly dangerous.
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">Cupholders</a> 
free the hands to do what they should be doing: controlling the wheelchair 
or scooter. In fact, there are even
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">cupholders 
for walkers</a>.</p>
<p>Safety isn't just the concern of the person using the wheelchair, walker, or 
scooter. You, as a caregiver, no doubt realize that safety is 
important--and often difficult to maintain. To help you out, there are 
many devices, one of which is called the
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">casbar</a> to 
allow you to push the wheelchair with one hand while going in or out of doors. Does your patient, spouse, or 
parent have an arm or leg involuntarily ""fall off"" of the chair?
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">Arm and leg 
supports</a> can help keep limbs in.
<a href=""http://www.caregiverproducts.com/site/270651/page/913262"" target=""_blank"">Side and wing 
back supports</a> are also safety devices that keep the person's torso snugly 
within the safe confines of the chair.</p>

Verilux full spectrum floor lamps have set the standard for natural, ""daylight"" lighting for more than 50 years. All Verilux floor lamps use full spectrum light to enhance the clarity and contrast of reading materials, projects, craft work and task work. Full spectrum light improves vision while reducing eyestrain and fatigue.  Our patented flicker-free ballast and Optix™ glare control filter are unique in the industry, delivering daylight intensity, full spectrum light, without glare.

The best light for reading, tasks, artwork or crafts is bright, natural, and glare free. Full spectrum light achieves this by delivering the ""full"" or ""natural"" light spectrum to your eye. Typical incandescent bulbs produce light only from the ""warmer"" red, yellow and orange parts of the visual spectrum, while completely missing the ""cooler"" blue portion of the spectrum. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a general acceptance of poor, yellowish light as the ""norm"" in homes and workplaces alike.",,"Verilux Floor Lamps","Floor lamps with full spectrum light to enhance the clarity and contrast of reading materials, projects, craft work and task work.

If they are fortunate enough, they may have a good network of relatives or 
caregivers available to shuttle them to shops, restaurants, and doctor's 
appointments.</p>
<p>Shuttle vans are great, but whatever happened to good old independence? 
Many persons with arthritis may wonder if that flew out the window when 
arthritis came along. We will illustrate how it is not only possible for 
persons with arthritis to be mobile and independent, but how this can help 
enrich their lives. This is best shown by a trip to the local 
library--independently.</p>
<h3>Many Ways to Be Mobile</h3>
<p>Mobility, of course, is all relative. To the bed-ridden, mobility can 
mean simply the ability to get out of bed and use the facilities by oneself. 
For others, mobility can mean being lucky enough to be able to use a
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">cane, 
wheelchair, or walker</a>.</p>
<p>For some, getting up is the hard part. This is best accomplished by the 
use of various
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461326"" target=""_blank"">helpful bars, 
handles, and lifts</a> that allow comfortable transition off of beds, sofas, and 
chairs.</p>
<p>After bathing and dressing, it's time to hit the road and go to the library!</p>
<h3>How Do You Carry Books With a Walker?</h3>
<p>Or a cane or wheelchair? That's the trick. Any arthritic person 
who has tried to balance books or groceries in one hand, while manipulating a 
wheelchair or cane with the other hand, can attest to the difficulty of this.</p>
<p>Luckily, the manufacturers of assistive arthritic devices have really put out 
some neat <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">
pouches, carts, and carry-alls</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are you fairly mobile on your own? Lightweight, folding shopping 
	carts are available to carry your books and some groceries, too.</li>
	<li>Use a walker? There are a surprisingly large number of baskets and 
	pouches to help users of walkers carry small items.</li>
	<li>For wheelchair users, extra-big backpacks which attach to the back of 
	the chair help carry items. (And by the way--don't you hate those cold 
	plastic arms on wheelchairs? Try some easy-to-slip-on fleece arm 
	covers!)</li>
	<li>A combo walker/scooter person? You've covered, too, with a slick 
	holder for your scooter--to carry your walker. Easy to put in, easy to 
	take out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Great Gadgets for Going Out!</h3>
<p>Besides carriers, you might need a few
<a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461344"" target=""_blank"">other items 
that make going out even easier</a>. Ever noticed how those super-grippy 
walker tips are great for slippery floors--but they snag on carpeting? 
Easy glide tips pop right on and let you slide the walker across carpeted 
surfaces (and don't all libraries seem to have carpeting?). Anticipate 
coming home late? Well, after a long evening, it's a snap to find your way 
home with a set of three bright-white LED lights made especially to attach to 
walkers.</p>
<p>So, stay out until the cows come home!</p>

wasa101,"wasa102","Walker Safety 101",,No,,,No,"articles","Usually ships the next business day",,"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/makinglifeeasier/",,,,"articles",,"Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Aids for Greater Mobility:Walker Articles and Information",No,,,"<P>Despite the fact that walkers are meant to assist persons who may have 
trouble on their feet, walkers could use some safety improvements. For many, 
walkers are hard to grasp; require the use of two hands, thus preventing a 
person from carrying items; and have a tendency to ""catch,"" often quite 
dangerously, on carpeting and other surfaces that are not perfectly smooth (or 
ironically, don't slide well on smooth surfaces).</P>
<P>Here is a short guide to maintaining walker safety, along with a list of some 
items that will assist in this goal:</P>
<H3><A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344384"" target=""_blank"">1. 
Hard to Grasp? Helping You to Grasp Your Walker...</A></H3>
<P>Walker hand grips are often anything but. Standard grips are smooth, hard, 
and unfriendly to the human hand. Not to mention, slippery when one's hand is 
wet. And don't you just love the feeling of cold steel on your hand in the dead 
of winter? Walker hand grips come in terrycloth or fleece, slip on in a snap, 
and help you to ""keep your grip."" </P>
<H3><A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344384"" target=""_blank"">2. 
Can't Carry Anything? Here Are Carrying Solutions...</A></H3>
<P>Manufacturers have been responsive to consumers in recent years by providing 
a wide range of carrying accessories for walkers. The classic ""big front bag"" 
for walkers has been improved upon, and other bags, boxes, and cases have been 
added for more specialized purposes.</P>
<P>You really can't beat the big front bag for carrying capacity. These bags 
tend to come in washable fabric and are nearly as wide as the walker itself. 
Often, you will find segmented compartments within these big front bags. Pockets 
can be accessed from the front, or from both the front and the back. Standard 
colors tend toward the darker hues, to resist dirt and staining, but attractive 
quilted walker totes are available, too.</P>
<P>With less capacity but easier to manage are the side bags, some large enough 
to accommodate books and magazines. Water resistant fabric keeps your valuables 
high and dry, should you get caught in a sudden downpour.</P>
<P>Even small items, such as cell phones, glasses, and keys can occupy one of 
your hands--at a time when you need two hands on the walker. Smaller cases, 
including some hard-shelled cases, can be found which free your hands to move 
the walker along.</P>
<H3><A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344384"" target=""_blank"">3. 
Walker Catches on Carpeting? Get These No-Snag Walker Accessories...</A></H3>
<P>One major complaint of walker users is that they are hard to move on 
carpeting and other non-smooth surfaces. A moving walker that suddenly stops 
moving is a recipe for an accidental somersault. Or the opposite problem is that 
the rubber tips won't slide on smooth floors!</P>
<P>Deal with uncooperative surfaces with neat walker accessories that help you 
glide along. While they won't help you slalom down the slopes, walker skis pop 
easily onto the walker legs and help you slide, rather than snag, on carpeting. 
</P>
<P>Skiing not your sport? How about tennis? Ball glides ingeniously use tennis 
balls to help the walker slide along over smooth surfaces like wood, tile, and 
vinyl flooring---and never leave a mark.</P>

April 27, 2007 - 4:02PM

Imagine not being able to drive a car, or pick up a pen, or pluck a weed from your garden.  It sounds like a nightmare, but for people with arthritis, it sometimes becomes their reality. 

One of the many activities some people give up at the onset of arthritis is gardening. The constant stooping, kneeling and gripping oftentimes becomes difficult for different parts of the body, from hands to knees to backs.

<a href=""http://wrightstuff.biz/eagrgato.html"" target=""_blank"">Easi Grip Garden Tools Trowel</a>

Difficult, yes. Impossible? No. According to physical therapists and other experts, all passionate gardeners can still pursue their favorite hobby. 

“People who want to maintain their independence can still continue to do what they want to do,” said Joy Loverde, author of The Complete Eldercare Planner. “They can do some homework to find all kinds of products that can enable them do the same things with a little bit of help.” 

When gardening, arthritis sufferers should consider using a combination of special tools and techniques. According to Fortino Gonzalez, a physical therapist at Ortho Sports, Inc. in McAllen, increasing the body’s range of motion is crucial for arthritis patients who love gardening. The way to do that, he said, is through exercise and stretching.

“It’s a matter of listening to your body,” he said. “Arthritic joints are not generally painful unless you’re not moving them normally. Many people that have arthritis have no pain. Walking, cardio and resistance training can make you more resilient (for these activities). You need to think: ‘What do I need to do to garden?’ Break down your activities. If you’re going to squat, do squats. Practice that activity.” 

Many people tend to be what Gonzalez described as “weekend gardeners,” enthusiasts who spend multiple hours toiling away. However, that approach can lead to big time aches. 

<a href=""http://wrightstuff.biz/eagrgatoseto.html"" target=""_blank"">Easi Grip Garden Tools Set of 3</a> 

Gonzalez recommends gardening at the time of day you feel most limber. Many people like to garden in the morning, but Gonzalez said to be cautious. When you sleep, the cartilage and discs between your bones re-hydrate, which makes them more susceptible to injury. It takes two to three hours once you wake up for this to fade: therefore, most back injuries occur within the first two or three hours of a person’s day. This can be prevented, however, by extension exercises (stretching in the opposite direction of intended movement). 

Whenever you decide to venture outdoors, be careful not to overdo it. 

“If you have a four-hour task, break it up,” Gonzalez said. “You don’t need to do four hours in one day. Do it for one hour a day for four days. For any activity over 30 minutes, it’s a good idea to get up and change positions.” 

There are other techniques that can aide the arthritic gardener, Loverde said. One of them is employing specially-made tools. Plenty of Web sites offer tools with enhanced grips or lengthened handles, all of which can relieve strain on achy joints. Additionally, gardeners also should consider carrying their tools with them in a pocketed apron to avoid wasting energy searching for the proper instrument.

<a href=""http://wrightstuff.biz/eagrloregato4.html"" target=""_blank"">Easi Grip Long Reach Garden Tools Set of 4</a> 

“There are pads that you can kneel on that turn into a bench,” she said. “There are also some reaching devices and pruning sticks available so you don’t have to bend down.”  You can also bring the garden to you, Loverde said. Raised flower beds, for example, mean less bending or kneeling. Windowsill gardens inside the house also are easy to maintain, she said. 

By using special tools, taking care of your body and consulting a physical therapist for proper exercise techniques, Gonzalez said gardening is a completely reasonable activity.  “It’s just like a running program,” he said. “Everyone’s body can adapt to stress. You start small and inch your way up. The idea is to not get into sticky moments.”

We have compiled a list of the major items any arthritic cook needs in order to prepare and eat healthy, tasty home cooked meals.","Articles and Information on Daily Living Aids:Arthritis Daily Living Aids:In The Kitchen",No,,,"<p>Most kitchens are packed with implements as big and weighty as cast-iron Dutch ovens and small appliances 
and as tiny as measuring spoons and grapefruit forks.  Yet out of all of those hundreds of items, consider how few are appropriate for the arthritic cook.</p>
<p>Arthritic persons who love to cook are often frustrated at how inappropriate most kitchen implements are.  We have compiled a list of the major items any arthritic cook needs in order to prepare—and to eat—healthy, tasty home-cooked meals.  And all without resorting to tasteless microwaved or restaurant meals. </p>
<h3>Kitchen Openers for Arthritic Persons:  Caps, Jars, Lids, and More</h3>
<p>Tight jars, bottles, and cans have to be the number one complaint for persons suffering from arthritis.  In fact, the jars and bottles don’t even have to be very tight for them to frustrate any cook—arthritic and non-arthritic alike. </p>
<p>Some manufacturers of kitchen openers have gotten smart about this—making <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/911539"" target=""_blank"">openers that help arthritic persons</a> open tough packaging in a jiffy.  These range from aids as simple as silicone grippers that can be stored after use…to cabinet- or wall-mounted jar openers always ready for easy opening.</p>
<h3>Cooking, Cutting, Slicing, and Spreading Tools for Arthritic Persons</h3>
<p>Here’s where the true art of cooking begins.  Knives are often a particular source of concern because of the discomfort associated with holding the handle.  Not to mention:  sharp blades are involved!  Manufacturers of <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461262"" target=""_blank"">adapted cooking products</a> have really stepped up to the plate in recent years by providing easy-to-grip knives and graters designed for arthritic persons.</p>
<p>What an amazing variety of knives, slicers, graters, and peelers are now available!  How about special cutting boards, too?  Bread spreader boards and pot holders (not the mitt type of holder, but the type that holds a pot to the stove) take the arthritic cook from raw food to cooked delicacy with speed and comfort.</p>
<h3>The Arthritic Cook Serves Dinner:  Adapted Plates, Utensils, and Cups</h3>
<p>Now that dinner is cooked, is it served yet?  Yes.  And eaten?  Yes again.  Perhaps the widest range of kitchen items for arthritic cooks—and arthritic diners—is in the area of specially adapted eating implements.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461169"" target=""_blank"">Plates and bowls adapted for arthritics</a> offer guards, scoops, 
and lips for keeping food on the plate.  But what about plates that seem to have a mind of their own and slide off the table?  Available too are special plates that hold fast to the table.</p>
<p>What arthritic person hasn’t found liquids to be even more elusive than food?  A vast array of <a href=""http://www.arthritissupplies.com/site/371928/page/461260"" target=""_blank"">cups and glasses for arthritics</a>, with special handles, grips, lids, and straws, ensure that the beverage gets to the mouth—every time, and without a drop spilled.</p>

accessories that make it easier for them to get around. But let's think for a 
moment about another group of people that spends a lot of time using 
wheelchairs--a quite <I>mobile</I> group of people. </P>
<P>These are the spouses, relatives, and caregivers who often assist wheelchair

things easier for these people--and by extension, help yourself, too?</P>

<P>Yes, nobody has ever claimed that handling a wheelchair is easy. Wheelchair 
grips are often not friendly to the human hand: slippery, cold to the touch, and 
not positioned correctly. The last thing you want is a caregiver who doesn't 
have a firm grip on the chair.</P>
<P>Improved, ergonomically correct wheelchair grips are the perfect answer. 
These grips slide right over the existing handle and tighten on with 
thumbscrews. They have a sure grip, but best thing of all: they are positioned 
correctly. These improved, super-safe grips allow the person pushing the 
wheelchair to move the chair with one hand while opening a door with the other

it Easier to Carry Your Packages</A></H3>
<P>With two hands on the wheelchair, how can your caregiver or spouse possibly 
carry any of your items? With a backpack? With a little red wagon?</P>
<P>Of course not. Should you go shopping or to the library, you will want a 
convenient bag or carrier that attaches to the wheelchair--completely freeing 
the assistant's hands to do what they should be doing: pushing. The variety of 
wheelchair bags and carriers is nearly endless, but let's help break it down for 
you.</P>
<P>Holding the largest capacity are wheelchair bags that attach to back of the 
wheelchair and are constructed of tough, water-resistant fabric. Carry giant 
items like cereal boxes, books, and canned goods with these huge bags. Should 
your caregiver have trouble pushing you <I>and</I> the wheelchair <I>and</I> 
this big-capacity carrier, downsized bags are also available that attach either 
to the back or side of the wheelchair. One perk about the side bags: they allow 
you to access the items, too.</P>
<P>Does your caregiver ever ask you to hold your coffee, soda, juice, or water 
for a moment while they push you along? Keep hands free--both yours and 
theirs--by clipping a cup holder to your chair. Cup holders attach easily, 
detach easily, and hold even the biggest cups.</P>
<H3><A 
href=""http://www.mobility-aids.com/site/492331/page/344394"" target=""_blank"">Making 
it Easier to Carry Your Medical Necessities</A></H3>
<P>Some things simply need to go along with you--medical necessities such as 
oxygen canisters or canes. It's inconvenient for a wheelchair user to carry a 
cane across his or her lap, and unsafe, too. Specially designed holders carry 
the cane vertically on back of the wheelchair. Oxygen canisters are even more 
bulky, cumbersome, and heavy. Smart oxygen tank holders stow the canisters on 
back of the wheelchair, allowing the person pushing the wheelchair to tend to 
the job of pushing the chair.</P>

The people who receive care usually need help with basic daily tasks. Caregivers help with many things such as:

Grocery shopping 
House cleaning 
Cooking 
Shopping 
Paying bills 
Giving medicine 
Toileting 
Bathing 
Dressing 
Eating 

Usually caregivers take care of elderly people. Less often, caregivers are grandparents who are raising their grandchildren. The terms informal caregiver and family caregiver refer to people who are not paid to provide care. As the American population ages, the number of caregivers and the demands placed on them will grow.

Who are our nation's caregivers?
About one in four American families or 22.4 million households care for someone over the age of 50. The number of American households involved in caregiving may reach 39 million by 2007.

About 75% of caregivers are women. 
Two-thirds of caregivers in the United States have jobs in addition to caring for another person. 
Most caregivers are middle-aged: 35-64 years old. 

<h2>What is caregiver stress?</h2>
Caregiver stress is the emotional strain of caregiving. Studies show that caregiving takes a toll on physical and emotional health. Caregivers are more likely to suffer from depression than their peers. Limited research suggests that caregivers may also be more likely to have health problems like diabetes and heart disease than non-caregivers.

Caring for another person takes a lot of time, effort, and work. Plus, most caregivers juggle caregiving with full-time jobs and parenting. In the process, caregivers put their own needs aside. Caregivers often report that it is difficult to look after their own health in terms of exercise, nutrition, and doctor's visits. So, caregivers often end up feeling angry, anxious, isolated, and sad.

Caregivers for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other kinds of dementia are particularly vulnerable to burnout. Research shows that most dementia caregivers suffer from depression and stress. Also, studies show that the more hours spent on caregiving, the greater the risk of anxiety and depression.

Women caregivers are particularly prone to feeling stress and overwhelmed. Studies show that female caregivers have more emotional and physical health problems, employment-related problems, and financial strain than male caregivers. Other research shows that people who care for their spouses are more prone to caregiving-related stress than those who care for other family members.

It is important to note that caring for another person can also create positive emotional change. Aside from feeling stress, many caregivers say their role has had many positive effects on their lives. For example, caregivers report that caregiving has given them a sense of purpose. They say that their role makes them feel useful, capable and that they are making a difference in the life of a loved one.

How can I tell if caregiving is putting too much stress on me?

If you have any of the following symptoms, caregiving may be putting too much strain on you:

Sleeping problems — sleeping too much or too little 
Change in eating habits — resulting in weight gain or loss 
Feeling tired or without energy most of the time 
Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy such as going out with friends, walking, or reading 
Easily irritated, angered, or saddened 
Frequent headaches, stomach aches, or other physical problems 
What can I do to prevent or relieve stress?
Take care of yourself. In the process, you'll become a better caregiver. Take the following steps to make YOUR health a priority:

Find out about community caregiving resources. 
Ask for and accept help. 
Stay in touch with friends and family. Social activities can help you feel connected and may reduce stress. 
Find time for exercise most days of the week. 
Prioritize, make lists and establish a daily routine. 
Look to faith-based groups for support and help. 
Join a support group for caregivers in your situation (like caring for a person with dementia). Many support groups can be found in the community or on the Internet. 
See your doctor for a checkup. Talk to her about symptoms of depression or sickness you may be having. 
Try to get enough sleep and rest. 
Eat a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and low in saturated fat. 
Ask your doctor about taking a multivitamin. 
Take one day at a time. 

Caregivers who work outside the home should consider taking some time off. If you are feeling overwhelmed, taking a break from your job may help you get back on track. Employees covered under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act may be able to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year to care for relatives. Ask your human resources office about options for unpaid leave.

Manufacturers build in certain devices to ensure a minimum degree of safety for

<P>For users who handle their own wheelchairs, you may know that the rims of 
wheelchairs can be slippery, narrow, and hard to grip. Foam-based wheelchair 
grips slide easily onto the wheel's rim and have removable, washable covers. 
Users who typically have caregivers pushing them may be aware that wheelchair 
handles are not friendly to the human hand. Like the wheel rims, they too are 
slippery and narrow. Ergonomic handles attach in a snap and let your caregiver 
push you in greater comfort and safety.</P>
